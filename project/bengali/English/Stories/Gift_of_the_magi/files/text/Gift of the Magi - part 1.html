<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">Della had one dollar and 87 cents. That was all. Almost half of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one or two at a time. When she bought her fruit and meat, she argued with the grocers for lower prices. When she paid, she always checked the change carefully. Now she counted the money she had saved three times. It was the same each time. She only had one dollar and 87 cents. And the next day would be Christmas.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">She could think of only one thing to do. She lay down on the couch and cried. Her apartment did not offer her much comfort, since the rent was only eight dollars a week.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">It is difficult to describe the apartment because there is not much to describe. The rooms were almost empty. They held few pieces of furniture, and the furniture was old.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">There was an electric doorbell next to the front door of the building. The doorbell was dead and useless. Above the doorbell, there was a small card with the name of Dellaâ€™s husband, Mr.&nbsp;James Dillingham Young. In former times, Mr. Young had earned 30 dollars each week, and his name on the card had been clear and bright. Now, he only earned 20 dollars each week. The card had become old and difficult to read. But when Mr. James Dillingham Young came home from work, Della always greeted him with a smile and a hug.</p></div>
