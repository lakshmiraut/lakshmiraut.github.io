<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">“Dell,” he said, “let’s put away our Christmas presents for the future. They’re very beautiful, but we can’t use them right now. I sold my watch to get the money for your combs. Now, I suppose you can cook dinner.”</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">You may be wondering about the title of this story and are asking, “Who were the magi?” The magi were wise men who brought gifts to the baby Jesus long ago. They gave the first Christmas gifts. They chose their gifts wisely and thoughtfully. Here I have told you the story of two young people who perhaps did not choose wisely and thoughtfully. They gave up the greatest treasures of their home to buy a gift for the one they love. But when people give love with their gifts, they truly are wise. People everywhere who give love as their gifts are wise. They are the magi.</p>

<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre"><strong class="calibre9 pcalibre pcalibre1">About O.Henry </strong> O.Henry’s real name was William Sydney Porter. He was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1862. When he was 20, he moved to Austin, Texas. There, he worked for a bank and a magazine. In 1895, he began working for a newspaper in Houston, Texas.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">A year later, the police began questioning him about his job at the bank in Austin. Porter had taken money from the bank. Before he could be arrested, Porter ran away to Honduras. There he was safe from the police, but he returned six months later because his wife was ill. Soon the police found him, and he was sent to jail.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">Porter began to write stories while he was in jail. He started using the pen name “O.Henry.” In 1901, he was released from jail. He worked for a newspaper in New York City and wrote one short story each week. Porter died in New York in 1910. He is famous for his short stories with surprise endings.</p></div>
