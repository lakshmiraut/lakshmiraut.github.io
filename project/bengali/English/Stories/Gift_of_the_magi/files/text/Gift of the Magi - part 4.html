<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">At seven o’clock, the coffee was hot, and Della was ready to cook dinner. Jim was never late. She held the new chain tightly in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door. When she heard Jim’s steps on the stairs, she was suddenly frightened. She whispered a quick prayer: “Please, God, make him think that I am still pretty.”</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">The door opened. Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and serious. His coat was old and worn, and he did not have any gloves. He was only 22 years old, and his life was difficult.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">Jim stopped inside the door and looked at Della. He did not move, and he did not speak. Della could not understand the expression on his face. She was frightened all the more. He did not show anger or surprise, but he stared at her in a strange way.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">Della slid off the table and went to her husband.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">“Jim, dear,” she said sadly, “don’t look at me that way. I sold my hair because I needed the money. I didn’t have enough money to buy a Christmas present for you. My hair will grow again. You’re not upset, are you? Don’t worry, my hair grows quickly. Please, Jim, say ‘Merry Christmas!’ to me, and let’s be happy. You haven’t seen the … the beautiful gift that I’ve bought for you.”</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">“You’ve cut your hair?” asked Jim. He looked confused.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">“I cut it off and sold it,” said Della. “You still like me, don’t you? I’m still the same person without my hair, aren’t I?”</p></div>
