<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">A few minutes later, she stood in front of a store. The sign above it read, “Mrs. Sofronie. All Types of Hair Products.” Della opened the door and ran upstairs. Mrs. Sofronie was large, pale, and unfriendly.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">“Will you buy my hair?” asked Della breathlessly.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">“Hair is my business,” said the lady. “Take off yer hat, and let’s have a look at yer hair.”</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">Della took off her hat. The shiny brown silk flowed over her shoulders.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">Mrs.&nbsp;Sofronie touched the hair like an expert.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">“I will give you 20 dollars,” she said.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">“Give it to me quickly,” said Della.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">The next two hours passed like a happy dream while Della looked in all the stores for Jim’s present.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">Finally, she found it. It was perfect. It was the only one of its kind, simple and elegant-a platinum chain for Jim’s gold watch. The chain had a quiet nobility, like Jim. After Della paid 21 dollars for it, she only had 87 cents left.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">As she hurried home, she said to herself: “Jim’s watch will look even more beautiful with the shiny chain.”</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">When she arrived home, she lit the gas stove and got out her curling irons. She sat in front of the mirror and began to fix her hair.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">After 40 minutes, her short hair was full of curls like a schoolboy. She looked carefully at her reflection in the mirror.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">“If Jim doesn’t kill me,” she said to herself, “he’ll say that I look like a girl in a cheap carnival. But I had to sell my hair! I only had one dollar and 87 cents!”</p></div>
