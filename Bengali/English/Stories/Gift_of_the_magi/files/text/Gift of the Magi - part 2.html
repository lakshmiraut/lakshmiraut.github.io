<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">Della finished crying and wiped her cheeks. She walked to the window and looked through the dirty glass. Outside, there was an old gray cat walking on a gray fence under a sky of gray clouds. It was the day before Christmas, and she wanted to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. But she only had one dollar and 87 cents. She had saved so carefully. It was not easy to live on a salary of 20 dollars a week. They never had enough money. Now, she did not have enough money to buy a present for her husband. She wanted to buy something fine and rare. Jim was a wonderful man, and he deserved a present of the best quality.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">Della turned away from the window and stood in front of a tall mirror. Her eyes were shining brightly, but her face was pale. Her hair fell over her shoulders.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">Della and her husband did not have many things, but they were extremely proud of two possessions. One was Jim’s gold watch. The watch had belonged to Jim’s father and grandfather. Jim’s watch was like a king’s treasure. The other valuable possession was Della’s hair. Her hair was more beautiful than a queen’s jewels.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">In front of the mirror, Della’s long hair shone like rich, brown silk. It reached below her knees and covered her body like a dress. She looked thoughtfully at her hair. A tear fell from her eye and splashed onto the worn red carpet. Then, she quickly put on her old brown jacket and hat. Her eyes shone brightly as she walked down the stairs to the street.</p></div>
