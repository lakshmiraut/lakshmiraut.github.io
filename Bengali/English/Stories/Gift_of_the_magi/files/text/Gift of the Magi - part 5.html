<h1>Part 5</h1><h1>Part 5</h1> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">Jim looked around the room curiously.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">“So, your hair is gone?” he said, like a man in a dream.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">“You don’t have to look for it,” said Della. “I sold it, and it’s gone. Today is Christmas Eve, dear. Be good to me because I sold my hair for your present. Maybe I no longer have much hair, but I will always have a great amoun~6f love for you. Should I cook dinner now, Jim?”</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">Suddenly, Jim seemed to wake up from his confusion. He put his arms around Della. They hugged silently. Then Jim took a package from his coat pocket and placed it on the table.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">“Dell,” he said, “please don’t think I am angry with you. I will always like you. Your hairstyle will never change my feelings for you. But, please, open the package on the table. Then you will understand my shock a few minutes ago”.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">Della’s fingers quickly tore through the string and paper. She opened the package and shouted with joy. But her joy instantly turned to tears.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">Inside the package, there were three elegant combs. They were truly beautiful, with small jewels on the shiny edges. Della had seen the combs in a store window. They were so expensive that she had only dreamed of owning them. But now, she could not wear them because her beautiful long hair was gone.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">She hugged the combs tightly. Then, she looked at Jim with a small smile and a tear in her eye. “My hair grows so quickly, Jim!”</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">And then, Della jumped up. Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. Della eagerly held it out to him on the palm of her hand. The chain’s bright inetal seemed to reflect her loving spirit.</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">“Isn’t it pretty, Jim? I hunted through the whole town to find it. Now you can look at your watch a hundred times each day and feel proud. Give me your watch. I want to put the chain on it and see how it looks.”</p> 
<p class="calibre7 pcalibre1 pcalibre">Instead of taking out his watch, Jim sat down on the couch.</p></div>
