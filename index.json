This paper introduces and empirically estimates a statistical multi-state time-to-event life history model of incidence of chronic diseases, disability and death at mid-ages, incorporating childhood factors and health behaviors. Many of the factors at the cellular level are unobserved or imperfectly instrumented with observed data, which causes biased estimates of the coefficients of included regressors. This paper corrects for unobserved heterogeneity biases, extending statistical techniques from the generally studied two-state models to the multi-state model of this paper. The paper uses the HRS (Health and Retirement Studies) dataset and takes the definition of disability as a health status that qualifies for the Social Security's DI (Disability Insurance) program or the SSI (Supplemental Security Income) program. The paper studies how various childhood factors and health behaviors are associated with probabilities of following various transition paths through the health states of normal health, illness with one-or-more chronic diseases, disability and death. The paper also carries out quantitative policy analysis of social policies, improving the childhood factors of various social groups on their probabilities of maintaining good health, encountering disability or death in mid-ages.

As individuals age, the homeostatic regulatory mechanism that controls physiological body systems--such as respiratory, cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, immune, and metabolic--becomes more and more frail in its ability to face internal and external stressors. This leads to one-or-comorbid chronic diseases (such as diabetes, cancer, vascular, musculoskeletal, cognitive and mental disorders), DI-qualifying disabilities or death. The speed of progression through these health states depends on the rate of depletion of one’s homeostatic health and frailty levels. Genetic and epigenetic factors comprised of internal and external environments, health care use, health related behavior and cognitive endowments modulate the depletion rate of homeostatic health over  life cycle. These, in turn, determine the likelihood of various pathways through the health states. I use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data to estimate a multi-state time-to-event model of pathways through these health states. I use  biomarkers such as BMI, CES-D, measures of cognitive health, and indicators of health related behaviors such as smoking, drinking, exercising and use of preventative care along the life-course as indicators of latent homeostatic health and frailty levels and how they affect the risks of following various pathways to disability or death before reaching age 65.","tags":["Disability","Time-to-event analysis","Health"],"title":"Pathways to disability and mortality in mid-ages: Estimates from the Health and Retirement Study Data","type":"talks"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

Using Social Security administrative data and a competing-risks model to estimate DI exit probabilities, I find that death is the primary reason for program exits among nearly all beneficiary subgroups during their first 9 years on the rolls. Relative to men, women have lower probabilities of exit because of death; younger women also have lower exit probabilities because of recovery. From the 1980s to the 1990s, the probability of exit because of death declined while the probability of exit because of recovery did not improve. Beneficiaries with certain impairments are noteworthy exceptions to these general outcomes.","tags":[],"title":"Exits from Disability: Estimates from a Competing Risk Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lakshmi K.

The innate ability and hence productivity level of an individual is private knowledge. Education not only increases productivity level, more so for the higher ability individuals, it also acts as a signaling device for one's innate productive ability for the purpose of job matching in the labor market. It is shown that in economies with one-time non-renegotiable wage contracts, there are generally multiple signaling equilibria, all being far away from generating the maximum attainable rate of social mobility and economic growth. There are no natural economic grounds that can guide to select a particular equilibrium. Various labor market practices such as quit, layoffs and promotions based on worker's or employer's subjective assessment of on-the-job realized productivity, or explicit wage contracts contingent on some publicly observed noisy measurement of realized productivity, can improve some of the inefficiencies, and hence increase the rate of economic growth and social mobility. The remaining inefficiencies, however, can only be removed by intervening in the education system. The paper analyzes briefly a few education systems, and within the dual private-public education system, the paper examines the role of school vouchers or subsidies to the children of poorer family backgrounds in improving the rate of economic growth and social mobility.","tags":["Theory"],"title":"Signaling Equilibrium, Intergenerational Social Mobility and Long Run Growth","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1457101800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1457101800,"objectID":"d47b13345d793e6953b8db24ac2c5e49","permalink":"https://lakshmiraut.github.io/talks/2016-3-04-iim-udaipur/","publishdate":"2016-03-04T14:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/2016-3-04-iim-udaipur/","section":"talks","summary":"This paper formulates a structural dynamic programming model of preschool investment choices of altruistic parents and then empirically estimates the structural parameters of the model using the NLSY79 data.

While subgame perfect equilibrium notion is more relevent to analyze individual incentives in this set-up, due to computational complexity and lack of an appropriate equilibrium selection theory, most previous studies employed the open-loop Nash equilibrium. This paper introduces a unifying notion of equilibrium in which behaviors are guided by best responses, given a fixed convention and bounded rational expectations about other agents' behaviors. The paper provides an evolutionary process for convention based on learning. When the process converges, the limiting equilibrium is shown to be a subgame perfect equilibrium. This procedure provides a rationale for equilibrium selection and a method to compute subgame perfect equilibrium locally. Using this procedure, the paper studies the effect of a social security program on local subgame perfect equilibrium level of intergenerational transfers, fertility rate and welfare of a representative agent.","tags":[],"title":"Learned Convention and Subgame Perfect Equilibrium in an Overlapping Generations Model with Two-Sided Altruism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lakshmi K.

Since in our model children are concerned with parents’ old-age consumption, agents have incentives to save less for old age and to have more children so as to strategically induce their children to transfer more old-age support. We formulate such strategic behavior within a sequential multi-stage game and introduce a notion of learning equilibrium to characterize equilibrium manipulative behavior and then study the consequences of such strategic manipulations on private intergenerational transfers, fertility and savings decisions, and on Pareto optimality of equilibrium allocation. We show that the learning equilibrium notion of the paper simplifies computation of subgame perfect equilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium is the longrun outcome of dynamic learning equilibrium paths (this aids in selecting, sometimes, a unique equilibrium among multiple subgame perfect equilibria), and an open-loop Nash equilibrium involves ”incredible” threats from children. We provide an alternative explanation for the existence of publicly provided social security program and examine its role to correct distortions created by strategic manipulation.","tags":["Theory"],"title":"Learning to Perfect Manipulation: Implications for Fertility, Savings, and Old-Age Social Security","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1412085600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1412085600,"objectID":"884dc20088177bac128cbd9da583a7b2","permalink":"https://lakshmiraut.github.io/talks/2014-09-30-ieg-education-signaling/","publishdate":"2014-09-30T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/2014-09-30-ieg-education-signaling/","section":"talks","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A Signaling Equilibrium Model of Intergenerational Mobility and Economic growth","type":"talks"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1408438800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1408438800,"objectID":"dc0fcda7e92a1733cdbb2b8fcf8d3a85","permalink":"https://lakshmiraut.github.io/talks/2014-08-19-ieg-education-in-china-india/","publishdate":"2014-08-19T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/2014-08-19-ieg-education-in-china-india/","section":"talks","summary":"I compare the education systems of China and India and examine what India can learn from the negative and positive experiences of China’s policy experiments with education during the Mao and the Post-Mao periods.

The incentives are formulated in a dynamic programming model within a counting process framework and estimated using the one percent Continuous Work History Sample (CWHS) of the Administrative data on around 3 million individuals. The paper examines the argument that the widening income gap between the rich and the poor in the eighties created strong incentives for workers to get onto the rolls by raising the replacement rates of the poor. The paper finds that while the replacement rate of the poor grew rapidly in the eighties, its effect on enrollment was not strong. The paper also shows that the effect of non-employment on the likelihood of one’s getting onto the program depends on the health status of the worker: a healthier worker (as inferred from the proxy variable for health constructed in this paper using work history) has a much lower probability of getting onto the program than a worker with adverse health shocks. Among various disability policies, the addition of Medicare benefits contributed most to the growth of disability entitlements; the mental listings and broadening of coverage to musculoskeletal and mental disorders have significant positive effect and the D\u0026A and Welfare reforms have significant negative effect in explaining the pattern of disability entitlements in the 80’s and 90’s.","tags":[],"title":"Economic Incentives and Social Security Disability Entitlements in a Counting Process Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lisa L.

Education was important for the children of the poor families to move up in the social ladder. But the lack of social, motivational and cognitive skills, which are important for school and labor market success, affects their social mobility. With a good preschool program, it is possible to create a structured learning ability, self-esteem, self-confidence and cognitive developments.

Workers also face uncertainty about their life spans, which affect their savings and consumption decisions. Many well-known economic characteristics of these risks prevent private markets from pooling these risks adequately. Pay-as-you-go social insurance programs -- by levying payroll taxes on workers and paying benefits to disabled workers, retirees, and survivors -- can substitute for these missing markets. In addition to sharing these two types of risks, such programs will affect the aggregate capital stock, consumption, and the elderly poverty rate. This paper models the risk sharing and the aggregate effects using a calibrated stochastic overlapping generations general equilibrium model. The paper uses as a benchmark the stationary equilibrium of an economy in which individuals self-insure themselves against these risks by adjusting their own saving, and compares this benchmark to the stationary equilibriums of economies with simplified old-age insurance (OASI) and disability insurance (DI) programs, alone and in combination (OASDI). The representative worker's lifetime welfare is computed in the benchmark and the alternatives. Optimal replacement rates for the model's OASI and DI programs are also calculated.The main findings of the paper are that the OASI and DI programs in the model economy together improve the lifetime welfare of workers, reduce the variation of consumption and asset holdings over the life cycle, and virtually eliminate elderly poverty that may arise from these two sources of income shocks. The welfare-equivalent increase in consumption at all ages in the benchmark would be about 14 percent for the DI program alone or 11 percent for the combined programs. The OASI program in the model, however, does not improve individual well-being. This might be due to several factors. First, similar to other models in the literature, this model assumes that the accidental bequest of an individual is redistributed equally among living individuals, which effectively mimics an actuarially fair annuity market with some progressive redistribution. This undermines the annuity role of the OASI program. Second, the model disregards the survivors' benefits components of the OASI program, which would increase the welfare of an individual from an increase in welfare of his survivors. The paper finds that the optimal replacement rate to be zero percent for the OASI program without the survivors' benefit component and with equal sharing of unintended bequest, and the optimal replacement rate for the DI program to be 90 percent.","tags":[],"title":"Disability and Mortality Risk Sharing within the OASDI Program","type":"talks"},{"authors":["Koichi Hamada","Lakshmi K.

A set of orderings of players equipped with a group structure induced from the group structure of automorphisms together with a measure structure on it constitutes a group of random orders in the analysis. For finite games it is shown that given any fixed group of random orders, the linear operator on the whole space of games that assigns to each game its expected marginal contribution is symmetric with respect to the associated group of automorphisms if and only if the randomness of the group of orders is generated by a right invariant Haar measure; as a corollary, the paper provides a group theoretic proof for the existence and uniqueness of random order Shapley value and semi-value operators that are symmetric with respect to the full group of automorphisms; the paper also shows that the random order semi-value operators constructed from a proper subgroup of orders coincide with the semi-value operators which are symmetric with respect to the full group of automorphisms on a linear subpace of games. Many of these results are also extended to games with continuum of players.","tags":[],"title":"Symmetry Axiom and Haar Measure for Random Order Shapley Value of Games","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1025429400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1025429400,"objectID":"dd7e9b8d41e4deb9a9c71af8e855431c","permalink":"https://lakshmiraut.github.io/talks/2002-06-30-wea-seattle-malaria/","publishdate":"2002-06-30T09:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/2002-06-30-wea-seattle-malaria/","section":"talks","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Economic Epidemiology of Malaria and Economic Growth","type":"talks"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1013938200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1013938200,"objectID":"6acf79366798c830b6fad34149e8b4e3","permalink":"https://lakshmiraut.github.io/talks/2002-02-17-japan-4th-collaboration-project-tokyo/","publishdate":"2002-02-17T09:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/2002-02-17-japan-4th-collaboration-project-tokyo/","section":"talks","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Immigration or Foreign Investment to Cope with Aging Crises of an Aging Open Economy","type":"talks"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"For further on malaria project at the World Bank, look at The World Bank Research Program: Abstract of current sudies, 2001\n","date":996852600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":996852600,"objectID":"04cf5d157a62b0ea0808c81d769f45ae","permalink":"https://lakshmiraut.github.io/talks/2001-08-03-iitk-malaria/","publishdate":"2001-08-03T15:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/2001-08-03-iitk-malaria/","section":"talks","summary":"This paper models the equilibrium dynamics of Malaria disease and growth in income.

These patterns of transfer are sometimes used to postulate the hypothesis that in less-developed countries, parental investment in their children is more like lending to children, since children cannot borrow from the private capital market to finance their education, whereas in developed countries, parental investment in their children is mainly due to parental altruism towards their children.","tags":[],"title":"Reciprocity with Two-sided Altruism in Intergenerational Transfers: Evidence from Indonesian Family Life Survey Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":928420200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":928420200,"objectID":"348f522691e8a32354f2659a39a00c9f","permalink":"https://lakshmiraut.github.io/talks/1999-06-03-world-bank-motives-for-investment/","publishdate":"1999-06-03T14:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/1999-06-03-world-bank-motives-for-investment/","section":"talks","summary":"This paper proposes two alternative models of intergenerational transfers linking parental investment in human capital of children to old-age support.

The process of human capital accumulation begins with parent's investment on the agent when he/she is a child. An important controversy in modeling such decision has been the issue of what is the motive for parents' investment in their children's human capital. A commonly observed fact is that while in all countries parents invest a substantial amount of resources in the human capital of children, in less developed countries substantial resource transfers occur from children to parents, whereas such resource transfers from children to parents are thinner in developed countries. These transfers patterns are sometimes used to postulate the hypothesis that in less developed countries parents' investment in their children is more like lending to children; whereas in developed countries parents' investment in their children is mainly due to the fact that parents are altruistic towards their children. These two different motives have different implications for growth and efficiency. Since parents can observe the children's abilities, and society cannot, under the first motive removing the credit constraints of the poorer parents will lead to higher growth and efficiency, whereas, under the altruism motive, there is always over-investment in less able children and thus lower growth and efficiency. Thus under the first motive the society can and under the second motive the society cannot rely on parents for attaining efficiency in allocation of educational investments. In this paper we first address these issues in a theoretical model, and then we use the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) data set to find evidence of Indonesian parents' motive.","tags":[],"title":"Motives for investment in human capital of children and their consequences: evidence from Indonesian Family Life Survey Data,(jointly with Lien H.

The chapter discusses the microeconomics of endogenous population: fertility, mortality, and investment in children. In the chapter,the aim of developing growth models with endogenous population is principally to explain why, as income grows, both birth and death rates fall, and stocks of both human and physical capital per capita increase over time.Review of existing neoclassical growth models with endogenous, but unspecified, population growth, suggests a wide variety of possibilities: multiple equilibria, some of which may be stable and others unstable, characterized by large populations with low per capita incomes or by small populations with high per capita income. Without knowing the ways in which population change is related to the stocks of capital, the level of population and other state variables of the economy, however, there is little to distinguish, which path may be followed.","tags":[],"title":"Chapter 20 Growth models with endogenous population: A general framework ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Levin","Lakshmi K.

The paper finds weak evidence for son preference hypothesis: The number of sons has no effect on the birth intervals of the Malays whereas it has significant negative effect up to three children for the Chinese. Regarding the replacement effect the paper finds that in response to a child death, parents like to have shorter durations up to fourth child and thereafter, the effect is not significant; the desired family size of the Chinese is higher than that of the Malays.","tags":[],"title":"Old-age Security and Gender Preference Hypotheses: A Duration Analysis of Malaysian Family Life Survey Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":814095000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":814095000,"objectID":"71bb063c498d25833e5f70ffd5884eaf","permalink":"https://lakshmiraut.github.io/talks/1995-10-19-toronto-aumann/","publishdate":"1995-10-19T09:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/1995-10-19-toronto-aumann/","section":"talks","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Random Order Approach to Aumann-Shapley Value and Haar Measure","type":"talks"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":809083800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":809083800,"objectID":"5429b951f1224879d63f682ee57d376d","permalink":"https://lakshmiraut.github.io/talks/1995-08-22-seventh-world-congress/","publishdate":"1995-08-22T09:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/1995-08-22-seventh-world-congress/","section":"talks","summary":"This paper provides a model of intergenerational social mobility and economic growth, in which innate ability of workers, and the type of their education and jobs determine the rate of technological progress and social mobility. The innate ability and hence productivity level of an individual is private knowledge. Education not only increases productivity level, more so for the higher ability individuals, it also acts as a signaling device for one’s innate productive ability for the purpose of job matching in the labor market. It is shown that in economies with one-time non-renegotiable wage contracts, there are generally multiple signaling equilibria, all being far away from generating the maximum attainable rate of social mobility and economic growth.

The paper finds weak evidence for son preference hypothesis--The number of sons has no effect on the birth intervals of the Malays whereas it has significant negative effect up to three children for the Chinese.

The earlier literature on the rate of growth of population,\". labour force and human capital were assumed to be exogenous. The recent literature, in contrast, explicitly recognizes their endogeneity. In addition, greater emphasis is placed on human as contrasted with physical capital in the growth process. Another strand of recent literature, labeled as \"new\" growth theory, is based on a misleading characterization of traditional neoclassical growth theory, namely, that it shows the steady state growth rate of income to be exogenous, and will equal the rate of growth of the labour force in the absence of exogenous technical change. Thus in the steady state per worker output and consumption are constant. A goal of 'new' theory is essentially to endogenize growth and to obtain sustained growth in per worker output and consumption, primarily by generating increasing scale economies in aggregate production. The resulting nonconvexities lead to multiple equilbria and hysteresis in some models.\nThe perceived problems with the neo-classical growth model are not inherent features of the model, but the consequences of assuming that the marginal product of capital diminishes to zero as the input of capital is increased indefinitely relative to labour. Instead of directly relaxing this assumption, the 'new' growth theorists in effect introduce a factor other than physical capital which is not subject to such inexorable diminishing returns. We take a different approach: we assume fertility and savings to be endogenous so that the rate of growth, labour and capital, and hence aggregate growth, to be endogenous. Second, we assume that population density has an external effect (not perceived by individual agents) on the production process either through negative congestion effect or through positive effect in stimulating innovation and technical change, so that the change in production possibilities is endogenous determined by fertility decisions of individual agents. Our model is not necessarily geared to generating balanced growth steady states and its non -linear dynamics generate a plethora of outcomes that include not only the steady state of the neo-classical model, but also growth paths not only without a steady state but are even chaotic. Per capita output grows exponentially (and super exponentially) in some of the examples.","tags":["Development Economics","Growth Theory","Overlapping Generations Models"],"title":"Endogenous fertility, technical change and growth in a model of overlapping generations","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":662549400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":662549400,"objectID":"308563d8c88376756b25a0564f32ddee","permalink":"https://lakshmiraut.github.io/talks/1990-12-30-aea-washington-dc/","publishdate":"1990-12-30T09:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/1990-12-30-aea-washington-dc/","section":"talks","summary":"The paper extends the Samuelsonian overlapping generations framework to encompass a variety of altruistic preferences, recasting it into a Lindahl equilibrium framework.

We are unable to reject the Hall hypothesis in tests for developing countries when we allow for varying interest rates. We do find evidence of a negative effect of inflation on consumption, and a positive relationship between the real interest rate and consumption. The evidence for the Hall hypothesis also suggests that Ricardian equivalence may be valid—this is Barro's hypothesis that the effect on savings is the same whether government deficits are financed through taxation or debt.

Monopoly power of a firm in the light industry has no significant effect on its R\u0026D activities; in the heavy industry, higher monopoly power to a firm reduces its purchase of technology, without affecting other R\u0026D activities; in the petro chemical industry, higher monopoly power to a firm reduces its purchase of technology, but this but this reduction is partially offset by an increase in in-house R\u0026D expenditures.","tags":[],"title":"R\u0026 D Behavior of Indian Firms: A Stochastic Control Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lakshmi K.

Continuity of preferences defined over time paths of consumption imposes behavioral restrictions such as impatience or myopia. The first essay extends the different notions of myopia due to Brown and Lewis, and their characterization of the Mackey topology in terms of myopia, from $\\ell_{\\infty}$ to $L_{\\infty}$. This characterization is then used to extend Araujo's theorem on the necessity of impatience for the existence of competitive equilibrium from $\\ell_{\\infty}$ to $L_{\\infty}$.\nIn the second essay, an overlapping generations macro model of popul ation growth and capital accumulation that generates the decisions of rich and poor families regarding number of children and savings is used to study the interactions among population growth, capital accumulation, skill composition of l abor, and income distribution. Tax transfer policies that can be used to affect these variables are also analyzed. The model provides an alternative to the Beckerian models for expl aining the inverse household income-child quantity relationship observed in most developing countries.\nThe third essay develops a decision theoretic model of R \u0026 D behavior incorporating time and uncertainty in the process of knowledge creation within an optimal stochastic control framework. The sources of knowledge are taken to be purchase of technology and know-how abroad and domestically as well as in-house R \u0026 D investment. The model is estimated with data from three groups of Indian manufacturing industries (light, petro-chemical, and heavy). In all three industries the bigger firms tend to substitute domestic for foreign purchase of technology and technical know-how, and in heavy industry they also do more in-house R \u0026 D. Monopoly power has no significant impact on light industry R \u0026 D activities. In the other two, it reduces firms' pur'chase of technology without changing significantly their other R \u0026 D activities. In the case of the petrochemical industry this reduction is offset partially by an increase in in-house R \u0026 D efforts. Patenting stimulates further in-house research only in the light and petro-chemical industries. While the petro-chemical and light industries conduct more basic research, heavy industry does only minor adaptive research in in-house laboratories.","tags":["Social Mobility","Economic Theory","R\u0026D","India"],"title":"THREE ESSAYS ON INTER-TEMPORAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":420456600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":420456600,"objectID":"def592f361dfc2d080f6d8e36372fca3","permalink":"https://lakshmiraut.github.io/talks/1983-04-29-northeast-dev-consortium/","publishdate":"1983-04-29T09:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/1983-04-29-northeast-dev-consortium/","section":"talks","summary":"This paper studies the inter-temporal relationships among population growth, income distribution, inter-generational social mobility, skill composition of the labor force, and household income in an overlapping generations general equilibrium model that aggregates household decisions regarding fertility, savings and investment in human capital of children. It shows that as a consequence of endogenous fertility, the equilibrium path attains steady state from the second generation. Income tax transfer, child taxation, and social security taxation policies that can be devised to affect these variables are also analyzed. The model provides a structural explanation for the inverse household income-child quantity and negative child quality-quantity relationships that are observed in developing countries. It also shows that group interests may hinder the emergence of perfect capital markets with private initiatives.","tags":[],"title":"Capital Accumulation, Income inequality, and Endogenous Fertility in an Overlapping Generations General Equilibrium Model","type":"talks"},{"authors":["Lakshmi K Raut"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":360201600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":360201600,"objectID":"d8baf7ba01e51c4c7666f32762fc920f","permalink":"https://lakshmiraut.github.io/publication/unpublished/1981-1-1_random-order-semi-value_unpublished/","publishdate":"1981-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/unpublished/1981-1-1_random-order-semi-value_unpublished/","section":"publication","summary":"The orderings of players on games with continum of players is generated with a group of automorpshims of the players set $[0,1]$.
