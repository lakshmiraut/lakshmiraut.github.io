<big><big>I love reading research articles and books </big></big><big><big>typeset </big></big><big><big>with LaTex in pdf format. I also love these articles in html format which has its own charms. &nbsp; Quite a few times, the work place, or some publishers require documents to be prepared in the Microsoft Word format.&nbsp; It has been always a struggle to find an open source software to convert LaTex document with maths, figures and equations to Microsoft word and html formats in a straightforward way. Part of my work involves statistical and econometric analysis using various statistical softwares on Big Data using SAS, R and more recently Python.&nbsp; Many times, I struggled to recollect which paper involved what codes using which software.&nbsp; Moreover, when I modify the dataset, I end up manually change all the tables, figures and reference to the estimates in the text body. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Simply gruesome.</span>&nbsp; I then came across the R markdown document processing system which can create a document embedding R and other software codes directly in the R markdown document and then apply knitr (which in the backend uses Tex processing system, pandoc, and other R packages) to convert the R markdown document to html, word and pdf (or LaTex) documents.&nbsp; It can also produce other formats. This is part of what is known as Reproducible Research which many journals and publishers insist one to provide.&nbsp; Let me raise <span style="color: red;">warnings</span> here, you may have to tweak the converted Microsoft Word and LaTex documents to make them look nicer.&nbsp; But those can be done at the final production stage and generally require very little effort. <br><br>You can prepare your document in R markdown format from the beginning. But many of us have written papers in LaTex and need to convert them to other formats.&nbsp; So, using my spare time, I wrote this little package <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Tex2Rmd</span> using C++ and Java.&nbsp; This package is just a single executable file and can be run in 32bit or 64bit Windows systems or on a 64bit Linux system. All you need is just download the executable file for your operating system and run it on your LaTex document.&nbsp; I also provide a mini guide and examples below.&nbsp; <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; color: red;">Disclaimer and Limitations:</span> The program
currently is able to convert&nbsp; Equations (displayed and inline), Figures (Tikz and png graphics). </big></big><big><big>For tables,&nbsp; it creates only a
template with caption and label. Reference to a table, figure, equation, theorem, remark and many more LaTex environments is&nbsp; converted throughout in the converted R markdown documents. (To do it manually has been really painstaking, so I do it here programmatically). The user can prepare the table body programmatically using various R packages for nice looking tables either running R/Python codes on the dataset or linking to the excel, csv files with the table elements. I created this software for my own use to take care of the above worries I had.&nbsp; I am sharing it online for&nbsp; the world if others like to use it to their advantage.&nbsp; I am&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">not accountable</span> if it does not produce results to your satisfaction.&nbsp; Your comments are always welcome, I will try to incorporate those during my free time.<br><br>Downloads: Go to the page <a href="https://github.com/lakshmiraut/Tex2Rmd/releases/tag/V0.1">https://github.com/lakshmiraut/Tex2Rmd/releases/tag/V0.1</a> which has all the materials you need.
