          <b>Questions 7-19 are based on the following
passages.</b>
        </p>
        <h3 xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">Passage 1</h3>
        <pre xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">The populating of nearly one billion acres
	of empty land west of the Mississippi occurred
	in a series of peristaltic waves, beginning in
	Line the 1840s and continuing for the rest of the
(5) 	century. First to arrive was the advance guard,
	the trailblazers-explorers, trappers, and
	mountain men, hide and tallow traders, freelance
	adventurers, the military. Then the settlers
	in their wagon trains lumbering over the
(10) 	Oregon Trail to the lush meadows of the
	Oregon Territory and the inland valleys of
	California. Ncxt, thc gold-scckcrs, bowling
	across the plains and deserts pell-mell in 1848,
	working up and down the California mountain
(15) 	ranges, then backtracking to the gold and silver
	country in the Rockies and the Southwest.
	And finally, a last great wave, first by wagons,
	then by railroads, to mop up the leapfrogged
	Great Plains. By 1890 the great movement
(20) 	wesl was over, ending in a final hurrahing
	stampede of bmrners into Oklahorna Territory,
	a rush of humanity that created entire towns in
	an afternoon.
	The vast, empty land demanded new tools,
(25) 	new social organizations, new men and
	women. And it produced a new canon of
	myths and heroes-the stuff of countless dime
	novels, Wild West shows, movies, and television
	series for later generations. The heroes
(30) 	are familiar enough-the cowboys, the lawmen,
	the gamblers, the gold-hearted dancehall
	girls, the bad men too, for heroes need
	evil to conquer. The western town played a
	part, too, rnainly as backdrop and chorus,
(35) 	before which the central figures enacted their
	agon (struggle; contest). The fictional western
	town was as rigidly formalized as the set for a
	Japanese No play-the false-front stores on a
	dusty street lined with hitching rails, the
(40) 	saloons with bar, gambling tables, and stage
	for the dancers, the general store, the jail, and
	the church. The people of the chorus had a
	stereotypical fortn-women in crinolines and
	the rnen in frock coats and string ties, their
(45) 	striped pants tucked into boots. Their lives
	were projected as dim, ordinary, law-abiding
	shadows, against which were contrasted the
	bold- hued dramas of the principals. These
	were the "decent folk," whom the heroic law-
(50) 	nen died for; they were the rneek who would
	inherit the set after the leading actors left and
	the last wild cowboy was interred in Boot Hill.
	Colorless, sober, conservative, salt-of-the-earth,
	they represented the future-and a dull one it
(55) 	was. Occasionally, as in the film High Noon,
	their passive virtues were transmogrified into
	hypocrisy and timidity, mocking the lonely
	courage of the marshal they had hired to risk
	his life for them. The implication was: Are
(60) 	these dull, cautious folk really the worthy
	heirs of the noble cowboys? In Steven Crane's
	short story The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky, the
	last cowboy is a drunken anachronism, wearing
	his nobility in tatters, yet not to be
(65) 	scorned.</pre>
        <h3 xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">Passage 2</h3>
        <pre xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">It was the miners who established the first
	outposts of the Far West. The discovery of
	gold in California had transformed that com-
	Line monwealth from a pastoral outpost of New
(70) 	Spain to a thriving American state and had
	opened up new and varied economic activities-
	farming , shipping, railroading, and manufacturing.
	That experience was to be repeated
	again and again in the history of the mining
(75) 	kingdom; in the rush to Pike's Peak country in
	1859, to Alder Gulch and Last Chance in
	Montana and the banks of the Sweetwater in
	Wyoming in the middle sixties, to the Black
	Hills of the Dakota couno in the seventies.
(80) 	Everywhere the miners opened up the country,
	established political communities, and laid the
	foundations for more permanent settlements.
	As the gold and silver played out or fell into
	the hands of eastern corporations and mining
(85) 	fever abated, the settlers would perceive the
	farming and stock-raising possibilities around
	them or find work on the railroads that were
	pushing in from the East and West. Some
	communities remained almost exclusively
(90) 	mining, but the real wealth of Montana and
	Colorado, Wyoming and Idaho, as of
	California, was in their grass and their soil.
	Even in mineral wealth the value of the precious
	metals which had first lured adventurers
(95) 	was shortly exceeded by that of the copper
	and coal and oil which were so abundant. . .
	Even while the miners were grubbing in
	he hills or Nevada and Montana, a new and
	more important chapter was being written in
(100) 	the history of the West. This was the rise of
	the cattle kingdom. The physical basis of the
	kingdom was the grasslands of the West,
	stretching unbroken from the Rio Grand to
	the northern frontier, from Kansas and
(105) 	Nebraska into the Rocky Mountain valleys.
	Here millions of buffaloes had roamed at will,
	but within two decades the buffalo was to
	become almost extinct and its place taken by
	even more millions of Texas longhorns and
(110) 	Wyoming and Montana steers. . . .
	The cattle kingdom, like the mining, had
	its romantic side, and the remembrance of this
	has persisted in the American consciousness
	after the cattle kingdom itself has vanished.
(115) 	The lonely life on the plain, the roundup, the
	hieroglyphic brands, the long drive, the stampede,
	the war with cattle rustlers, the splendid
	horsemanship, the picturesque costume
	designed for usefulness, not effect-the wild
(120) 	life of the cow towns like Abilene and
	Cheyenne, all have found their way into
	American folklore and song. Children array
	themselves now in imitation cowboy suits,
	moving-picture ranchmen shoot down rustlers
(125) 	with unerring aim, and the whole country
	sings what was reputed to be President
	Franklin Roosevelt's favorite song:
	Home, home on the range,
	Where the deer and the antelope play
(130) 	Where seldom is heard, a discouraging word,
	And the skies are not cloudy all day.</pre>
