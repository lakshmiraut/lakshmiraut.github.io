	<h1 align="justify"><b>From Perterson's Guide</b></h1>
	<h2 align="justify"><b>Who should take the SAT?</b></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">You, if you are reading this! High school students generally 
	take the SAT in the spring of their junior year or the fall of their senior 
	year in order to meet application deadlines. Since scores tend to improve 
	with each year of schooling, you should not take the SAT before junior year. 
	However, you also shouldn't take the SAT at the last possible minute. That 
	way, you can take it again if you are disappointed in your score. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">Since many schools accept both the ACT and the SAT, you may 
	be wondering which you should take. Both are curriculum-based tests; they 
	attempt to measure what you know in a variety of subjects. Both the SAT and 
	the ACT test critical reading skills, writing skills, and math; only the ACT 
	tests science. The SAT is more common on the east and west coasts, while the 
	ACT is more common in the middle of the country. Neither test is &quot;better&quot; or 
	&quot;easier&quot; than the other; you should take the test with which you feel more 
	comfortable. </font> </div>

	<b><font size="4">What should I expect to see on the SAT?</font></b></h2>
	<p align="justify"><b><i><font size="4">Format</font></i></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">The SAT consists of 10 sections and will take 3 hours and 45 minutes to 
	complete, including breaks. There are 3 Critical Reading sections, 3 Math 
	sections, 3 Writing sections, and one experimental section that could be 
	Critical Reading, Math, or Writing, although it will not be an essay. The 
	experimental section will not be scored.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><i><b><font size="4">The Writing Sections</font></b></i></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">One Writing section will require you to write an essay in 25 minutes. You 
	will be asked to write about a specific topic, which could be on any 
	subject, but it will not require specialized knowledge. It will be graded 
	based on how clearly you express your ideas, how well you structure your 
	essay, and how accurately you use language.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">The other two Writing sections (one is 25 minutes long and one is 10 
	minutes long) consist of three types of multiple-choice questions. Error 
	Identification questions ask you to find the error, if there is one, in a 
	sentence. Sentence Improvement questions ask you to select the best version 
	of an underlined portion of a sentence. Paragraph Improvement questions ask 
	you to read an essay and answer questions about it. Most of the questions 
	are about how the essay is organized or how the ideas are developed.</font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><i><b><font size="4">The Critical Reading Sections</font></b></i></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">Two Critical Reading sections are 25 minutes long and one is 20 minutes 
	long. These sections consist of Sentence Completions and passage-based 
	reading comprehension questions. All questions are multiple choice. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">Sentence Completions are sentences that contain a blank or blanks in 
	place of a word or words; you have to use the context clues and your 
	knowledge of vocabulary to determine which of the words in the answer 
	choices best fits in the sentence.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">Reading comprehension questions are based on passages given in the 
	sections. These questions will ask about vocabulary, the structure of the 
	passage, the writer's purpose for writing, details in the passage, the main 
	idea of the passage, and the author’s writing style. Some passages will be 
	short (about a paragraph in length), while others will be long (about 4-6 
	paragraphs in length). There will also be sets of paired short passages and 
	paired long passages. Questions that follow these sets may ask about both 
	passages individually and may ask you to compare and contrast both passages.</font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><i><b><font size="4">The Math Sections</font></b></i></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">Two Math sections are 25 minutes long and one is 20 minutes long. One of 
	the 25 minute sections contains some multiple-choice questions and some 
	student-produced response questions (also called grid-ins). The 
	student-produced response questions have no answer choices; you must 
	determine the answer on your own and enter it into the grid provided. The 
	other two Math sections contain all multiple-choice questions. Topics tested 
	in the Math sections include numbers and operations, arithmetic, algebra, 
	geometry, and data analysis.</font></div>

					<b><font size="4">The Five Elements of an Essay</font></b></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">There is no strict 
					formula for writing a good SAT essay. You may write an essay 
					that is narrative, expository, persuasive, or argumentative. 
					To support your ideas, you may draw on a wide base of 
					knowledge: from the classroom, from literature outside of 
					school, from extracurricular activities, from current 
					events, and from personal observation or experience.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">Essay readers do not grade based on whether they agree 
					with your opinion. Readers do, however, grade based on 
					whether you write on the given topic. An essay that does not 
					address the prompt receives a score of 0.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">You are not expected to write a polished essay in 25 
					minutes. Readers grade based primarily on the five elements 
					of an essay, detailed in the table below. If these elements 
					are presented effectively, the essay will score high. If one 
					or more of these elements are flawed, the reader will deduct 
					points.</font></p>

					<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">SAT Essay Scoring Guide</font></b></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">Essays are graded holistically. This means that while you 
					should keep all of the five elements in mind as you read, 
					you should score your essay based on an overall impression. 
					Small errors of fact, spelling, or grammar should not cause 
					you to deduct points.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">On the official SAT, two readers independently mark each 
					essay to ensure a fair and accurate score. Each reader 
					assigns a score from 0 to 6, yielding a combined score from 
					0 to 12. In the event that the readers’ scores differ by 
					more than one point, a third reader gives the decisive 
					score. This score is then doubled to get the final combined 
					score.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">For this test, you will grade your own essay. After 
					reading the essay and considering how effectively it 
					demonstrates each of the five elements, assign it a score 
					from 0 to 6. The information below explains what these 
					numbers mean.</font></p>

					<p align="justify"><b><i><font size="4">(Score = 1)</font></i></b></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">The student does state his opinion—that persistence is 
					more important than education and talent for success—but a 
					single paragraph cannot possibly develop his point. Though 
					the student attempts to provide an example, he offers no

					<p align="justify"><font size="4">Persistence is the most important, above talent, genius 
					and education. If you have persistence, you know that no 
					matter what happens to you, no matter what problems you 
					might have you know that you are going to get over it. For 
					example if you want to peruse a long career like being a 
					loyer and you know that's what you want to do, with 
					persistence you will do it and will never give up when the 
					hard moments of your career come.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">Most of the times when you have talent or you are a 
					genius or educated it will not take you anywhere because 
					when the difficult times come, if you don't have persistence 
					you will not resist the hard times. Like when a celebrity 
					whose really rich just buys big cars and houses or jewlerry 
					and didn't try to save anything, and then when they loose it 
					all they wondered why they have no more money. It's because 
					they should &quot;press on&quot; to save their money and not buy so 
					many big expensive things.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">Persistence is more important and will lead you to get 
					over all the problems you might have. It will take you far 
					if you want, and also will make you more successful than 
					someone whose really smart but never works hard.</font></p>

					<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Peterson's Evaluation #2</font></b></p>
					<p align="justify"><b><i><font size="4">(Score = 2)</font></i></b></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">In the first paragraph, the student sets up her argument: 
					that persistence is the most important element for success 
					because it allows one to overcome problems. This paragraph 
					also provides a vague example, one that may be appropriate 
					but lacks any supporting detail.</font></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">The second paragraph offers a more concrete example with 
					some detail to back it up. Unfortunately, the sloppiness of 
					the sentences clouds the example's meaning a bit. Also, the 
					writer's decision to cite the phrase &quot;Press on,&quot; though not 
					a poor one, is not well connected and does little to enhance 
					the example's effectiveness.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><b><i><font size="4">(Score = 3)</font></i></b></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">The quote of Calvin Coolidge is nor right or wrong. 
					Persistence and talent although totally different ideas tend 
					to go hand in hand. In order to be successful in whatever 
					you are setting out to do it is important for you to be both 
					persistent and talented. It is hard to accomplish your goals 
					without having a little bit of both in you.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">If you had a great deal of talent but you tended to give 
					up easily and not try your best at all possible times, then 
					the likely hood of you reaching your goals is very slim. It 
					is the same thing with persistence. If you had tons of 
					persistence and never gave up, whenever you fell down you 
					would just get back up, but you didn't have any talent to go 
					along with it, then you might not get very far either. So 
					basically the two characteristics go hand in hand and tend 
					to play off one another. They are a dynamic duo that make 
					for a very accomplished and successful person.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">Now, the idea in the quote is that determination and 
					persistence are the most valueable of characteristics to 
					achieve and that talent doesn't really matter if you have 
					determination and persistence. I think that some of this is 
					true. If you are so determined and dedicated that you would 
					never give up, eventually you will get where you want to go. 
					The drive to complete what you want will get you to places 
					that you dreamed of. It might take longer then you might 
					have liked or preferred but all your hard work and 
					consistancy got you where you wanted to go. On the other 
					hand I think it is also untrue in many ways. If you had the 
					best singing voice and went to an audition, they would 
					probably give you a job right away and you could get far 
					like that. I think that either way you go, you should be 
					able to reach your dream, you will find a way. It takes 
					talent, determination, and a lot of persistence. You can 
					make it without one, but you won't be able to make it as far 
					and to the place you might have wanted.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">This all means that to succeed, you can just have one 
					sensational characteristic like talent, persistence, or 
					determination. You don't need all of them together. 
					Determination on its own can spark into persistence which 
					means you have two out of the three essentials for thriving. 
					Talent can spark determination once you get started. Even 
					persistence can create a burst of talent after all of that 
					trying and consistancy, but it might be in a different field 
					of expertise. The thing is, that everyone has a good thing 
					in them which can lead into another thing and another thing 
					ultimately getting you to where you are and where you always 
					dreamt of going. Each person has something to there 
					advantage and if they use it in the right way then they'll 
					get even more things to help them achieve their wildest 
					dreams.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">The quote was in a way right but also very wrong. 
					Persistence and determination can get you far but so can 
					talent. Which just proves that people all have a special 
					gift to use to help them get to their dream goals and 
					achievments, but if you don't use what it is you have, you 
					wont get where you want to and you will end up poor and 
					persistent or poor and talented, or even poor and 
					determined. It is all up to the person and their own 
					character.</font></p>

					<p align="justify"><b><i><font size="4">(Score = 3)</font></i></b></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">The writer begins by arguing that Coolidge's quote was 
					only partially right. It is a strong thesis, and the first 
					paragraph is an appropriate introduction to the topic. The 
					second paragraph is little more than a restatement of the 
					first, except that it both broadens and clarifies the 
					author's argument: that persistence and talent &quot;go hand in 
					hand and tend to play off one another.&quot;</font></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">In the third paragraph, this idea is further expanded to 
					include one concrete example (a talented singer at an 
					audition) and a few conditions or even counterarguments. The 
					paragraph ends with another, more fleshed-out version of the 
					writer's view of success: &quot;It takes talent, determination, 
					and a lot of persistence. You can make it without one, but 
					you won't be able to make it as far and to the place you 
					might have wanted.&quot;</font></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">This view somehow falls apart in the fourth paragraph, 
					which contradicts everything before it. Up to this point, 
					the writer promoted the importance of having all attributes 
					(persistence, talent, education) together, but now he turns 
					around and states that &quot;to succeed, you can just have 
					one...you don't need all of them together.&quot; He goes on from 
					there and tries to add depth to the relationship among these 
					qualities, but the thesis has already been weakened.</font></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">The conclusion, though mostly in line with the 
					introduction's premise, tends to ramble without adding much 
					depth or understanding.</font></p>

					<p align="justify"><font size="4">Persistence to me is more important than talent and 
					education in achieving success. You can be smart and have 
					many special gifts, like playing the French horn or batting 
					1000, but if you don't apply yourself by practicing and 
					making time for your talents, you will have a tough time 
					succeeding.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">Many people settle for good or fair, like a medium SAT 
					score and a B or C average. But the more persistent they 
					are, the more they will strive for excellent, like a 2500 
					score or a 4.5 GPA. For example, great singers like Whitney 
					Houston and Christina Aguilera need to be determined and 
					push hard in order to keep their beautiful voices. 
					Otherwise, if Whitney spent her time doing drugs with Bobby 
					Brown or Christina did nothing but make dirty videos, their 
					amazing talents would be useless.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">During the Civil Rights movement, African-Americans were 
					put through alot of hardships to finally get the rights they 
					deserved. They were beaten, hosed down, and even killed to 
					become equal. They went through peaceful sit-ins, loud 
					protests and violent riots to gain their priviledges, just 
					like the slaves went through everything they went through to 
					gain their freedom and escape. Even though they were denied 
					their education, the African-Americans perservered and won 
					the battle of Equal Rights.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">I myself know what it means to have persistence. I had a 
					friend who played the clarinet really well. She had great 
					talent and potential but not the drive. Because she was lazy 
					she ended up dropping out of the band and never picked up 
					her instrument again. I, on the other hand, was less 
					talented at music but I have the perserverance and drive to 
					work hard. Because of this I practice the trumpet for 2 
					hours every day, and therefore I will end up at an important 
					music school like Juliard.</font></p>

					<p align="justify"><font size="4">The short but clear introduction is followed by three

					<p align="justify"><font size="4">I firmly disagree with Calvin Coolidge's statement that 
					persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. Since 
					the dawn of time, humans have pursued extraordinary dreams 
					and attempted colossal feats. Talent and education may not 
					be enough by themselves to make a person successful, but 
					even the hardest-working person, if untalented or 
					uneducated, cannot fully succeed in today's complex, 
					challenging world. I will demonstrate this hypothesis 
					through the examples of Stand By Me, Million Dollar Baby, 
					and Underdog.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">My first example of why persistence and determination 
					alone are not omnipotent is the group of friends--Gordy 
					Lachance, Chris Chambers, Teddy Duchamp, and Vern Tessio--in 
					the movie &quot;Stand By Me,&quot; based on Stephen King's novella 
					&quot;The Body.&quot; These four boys spend the entire movie walking 
					through fields, running across train tracks, and crawling 
					through leech-infested waters to find the dead body of Ray 
					Brower, so that they can be known as heroes throughout the 
					neighborhood for having discovered him. They do find him 
					first, before the gang of obnoxious hoodlums arrives, but 
					instead of taking credit for their accomplishment they end 
					up being cowards and writing an anonymous note to the 
					authorities. If the boys were smart, they would have stepped 
					forth and claimed their rightful prize.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">My second example against Calvin Coolidge's statement is 
					the character of Danger in Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning 
					movie &quot;Million Dollar Baby.&quot; Danger spends every waking 
					moment at the gymnasium, practicing his punches and his 
					fancy footwork, yet, when he finally ventures into the 
					boxing ring, his face is smashed to a bloody pulp. Had he 
					possessed any actual talent for the sport or at least 
					formally trained, he could have prevailed.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">My final example to show why I disagree is the cartoon 
					hero Underdog. Underdog possessed no real superpowers and 
					was forced to rely on secret energy pills. His minimal 
					intelligence often made him forget to take the pills, and 
					thus his powers would vanish.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">As I have shown you in the examples above, it is not 
					enough for a person to be persistent and ambitious if they 
					do not have the natural talent or necessary education to 
					support it.</font></p>

					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">The selected examples are mostly appropriate, and the 
					writer does a good job of connecting them to his thesis and 
					giving supporting evidence. These paragraphs could, however, 
					be improved with more<i> varied </i>examples (as opposed to 
					two movies and a cartoon) and with better time management. 
					The writer devoted so much attention to his first example 
					(including naming all of the characters!) that he was forced 
					to shorten his second example and even leave his third 
					example somewhat incomplete.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><b><i><font size="4">(Score = 6)</font></i></b></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">Calvin Coolidge believed that no amount of talent, 
					genius, or education could take the place of persistence. He 
					rightly contended that one could not succeed merely by 
					relying on one's innate abilities or inherited fortunes. 
					While I agree that success is unlikely without 
					determination, I believe that the greatest successes result 
					from a synergy of all of the above elements. The American 
					Revolutionary War and the women's suffrage movement are 
					testaments to the importance of combining persistence with 
					talent and resourcefulness.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">In 1775, responding to years of oppression and 
					aggression, Americans revolted against the British. America 
					was at an extreme disadvantage, as Britain had more weapons, 
					ammunition, and ships. The First Continental Congress, 
					however, had already begun to demonstrate America's 
					fortitude and versatility by ordering a freight and trade 
					embargo against Britain, placing limits on Parliamentary 
					power, and educating its citizens in the offensive and 
					defensive tactics of war. In combat, soldiers became 
					creative and resorted to any means necessary to obtain their 
					goals. They forged arms and spun uniforms from whatever they 
					could get their hands on; some even melted military metal 
					figurines into pellets to shoot. Ultimately it was the 
					Americans' combination of radical thinking and unwavering 
					determination that led them to victory.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">Another problem facing America shortly thereafter was the 
					forbiddance of women to vote. Throughout the nineteenth 
					century, activists Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, 
					and Victoria Woodhull worked ceaselessly to earn women this 
					essential right. They challenged women to stand up and 
					question their exclusion from politics; in doing so they 
					forced male politicians to consider that voting privileges 
					be based upon citizenship rather than gender. Stanton, 
					Anthony, and Woodhull fought for this and many other 
					causes--such as abolition, temperance, and property 
					rights--for more than half a century. Although they did not 
					live long enough to witness the fruits of their labor, their 
					persistence, coupled with their supreme intellectual 
					talents, directly resulted in the passage of the 19th 
					Amendment to the Constitution.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">Soldiers and suffragists are merely two examples of 
					persistence, determination, talent, and education together 
					solving &quot;the problems of the human race.&quot; Even today, people 
					all over the world battle tremendous odds to achieve 
					success, whether it be rising above poverty, escaping 
					religious persecution, ending domestic abuse, or following a 
					career path usually denied to one's race or sex. In a time 
					where global peace and communication are crucial, everyone 
					must &quot;press on&quot; by channeling his or her talents toward 
					purposeful resolutions.</font></p>

					<p align="justify"><b><i><font size="4">(Score = 6)</font></i></b></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">The writer uses appropriate historical examples to defend 
					her argument, and she supports both examples with plenty of 
					detailed evidence. In doing so, she employs smooth, flowing 
					transitions and displays a keen level of critical thinking. 
					The last sentence of each body paragraph also explicitly 
					justifies the given example in light of the writer's thesis.</font></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font size="4">Of particular note is the conclusion, which not only 
					emphasizes the initial argument but takes this argument a 
					step further. Here the writer goes &quot;above and beyond&quot; by 
					putting the premise into another, more current context and 
					even adding somewhat of a directive at the very end.</font></div>

	<b><font size="4">Where can I register for the SAT?</font></b></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">There are several ways to 
	register for the SAT. If you wish to register by mail (which is required of 
	test takers with special needs), you need to obtain a Registration Bulletin 
	from your school counselor's office. If you do not need any special 
	accommodations, you can register online at the test maker's Web site:

	1-866-756-7346.</font></div>
<div class="problemTypes">
	<h2 align="justify"><b><font size="4">Why do colleges require the SAT?</font></b></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">Colleges look at many different factors when comparing 
	applicants. Transcripts, class rank, teacher recommendations, essays, and 
	interviews all play an important role in evaluating applications. But how 
	well can colleges compare grades that were earned at different schools? 
	Maybe the same work that earned a C+ at your high school would have been 
	graded as an A- at the school in the next district. Colleges use the SAT 
	because it provides a standard way to compare all applicants. Everyone takes 
	the same test, so colleges know how to interpret score reports. This is not 
	to say that the SAT is an objective measure of intelligence or ability; 
	everyone knows very intelligent people who simply &quot;don't test well.&quot; That's 
	why colleges look at your SAT score as just one part of your application 
	among many.</font></div>
<div class="problemTypes">
	<h2 align="justify"><b><font size="4">How is the SAT scored, and how can I improve my score?</font></b></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">Score reports can be confusing. There are raw scores, scaled 
	scores, and percentile ranks, each of which is calculated separately for 
	Critical Reading, Writing, and Math. Here's a brief summary of how these 
	scores are calculated and what they mean:<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><i><font size="4">Raw Score</font></i></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">Your raw score is calculated first. 1 point is added for 
	each correct answer, and a fraction of a point is subtracted for each 
	incorrect answer (except for incorrect Student Produced Responses, which 
	carry no penalty and the Essay, which is scored as a whole). A question that 
	is left blank neither adds to nor subtracts from your raw score. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><b><i><font size="4">Scaled Score</font></i></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">Your scaled score is then computed from your raw score using 
	a statistical process that accounts for slight differences between different 
	versions of the test. The scores on each of the three portions of the test 
	range from 200 to 800, giving you a total combined score range of 600 to 
	2400. The score report also gives a score range, which indicates the range 
	of scores you might expect to receive if you were to take the SAT several 
	times. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><b><i><font size="4">Percentiles</font></i></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">Your percentile rank tells you how well you did compared to 
	other students who recently took the SAT. For example, if your national 
	percentile is 56, then you scored better than 56 percent of the students who 
	took the SAT nationally. You are given a percentile for the nation and a 
	percentile for your state, which may differ based on the performance of 
	these two groups.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><i><font size="4">Maximizing Your Score</font></i></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">To maximize your score, you should familiarize yourself with 
	the format of the test and the content covered, and you should practice some 
	general test-taking tips. You can visit www.petersons.com for extensive SAT 
	preparation, but here are some basic tips for the meantime. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">1) <b>Keep a steady pace. </b><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">Pacing is important. Spending too much time on any one 
	question will keep you from scoring points on other questions. More 
	difficult questions will take somewhat more time, but remember that all 
	points are created equal: getting an easy question right improves your score 
	as much as getting a hard question right. Make sure that the time you spend 
	on a question is worth the point.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">2) </font> <b><font size="4">Make educated guesses. 
	</font> </b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">Statistically, you will improve your score by guessing when 
	you can eliminate at least one answer choice. If you can't eliminate any 
	answer choices, you should leave the question blank; but if you can 
	eliminate even one choice, then you should guess from among the remaining 
	choices.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">3)</font><b><font size="4"> Stay focused.</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">It's a long test, and your attention is bound to wander. If 
	you find that you are becoming distracted, look away from the test for a few 
	seconds and center yourself. Taking those few seconds to breathe and relax 
	will help you score more points when you return to the test.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">4) </font> <b><font size="4">Calm down.</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">Your state of mind is critical to your performance on 
	standardized tests. When you are taking the test, don't think about college 
	admissions or anything like that: just stay focused on the task at hand, 
	which is answering the questions to the best of your ability. Nervousness 
	distracts you and prevents you from maximizing your score. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4">Best of luck on the SAT!</font></div>
