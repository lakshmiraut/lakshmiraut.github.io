        <pre xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">There are several kinds of stories, but only
	one difficult kind-the humorous. The humorous
	story is American; the comic story,
Line 	English; the witty story, French. The humor-
(5) 	ous story depends for its effect upon the manner
	of the telling; the comic story and the
	witty story upon the matter. The humorous
	story may be spun out to great Iength, and
	may wander around as much as it pleases, and
(10) 	arrive nowhere in particular; but the comic
	and witty stories must be brief and end with a
	point. The humorous story bubbles gently
	along; the others burst.</pre>
        <h3 xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">Passage 2</h3>
        <pre xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">Line 	American humor, neither transfiguringly
(15) 	lucid and appropriate like the French, nor
	sharp and sensible like the Scotch, is simply
	the humor of imagination. It consists in piling
	towers on towers and mountains on mountains;
	of heaping a joke up to the stars and extending
(20) 	it to the end of the world. With this distinctively
	American humor Bret Hark had little or
	nothing in common. The wild, sky-breaking
	humor of America has its fine qualities, but it
	must in the nature of things be deficient in two
(25) 	qualities, not only supremely important to life
	and lemrs, but also supremely important to
	humor-reverence and sympathy. And these
	two qualities were knit into the closest texture
	of Bret Harte's humor.</pre>

          <b>Questions 10-15 are based on the following
passage.</b>
        </p>
        <p xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" />
        <pre xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">A long dispute followed this declaration;
	but Mr. Bennet was firm: it soon led to
	another; and Mrs. Bemet found, with amazement
	and horror, that her husband would not
(5) 	advance a guinea1 to buy clothes for his
	daughter. He protested that she should receive
	from him no mark of affection whatever, on
	the occasion of her marriage. Mrs. Bennet
	could hardly comprehend it. That his anger
(10) 	could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
	resentment, as to refuse his daughter a
	privilege, without which her marriage would
	scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she
	could believe possible. She was more alive to
(15) 	the disgrace, which the want of new clothes
	must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to
	any sense of shame at her eloping and living
	with Wickham, a fortnight before they took
	place.
(20) 	Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that
	she had, from the distress of the moment, been
	led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their
	fears for her sister; for since her marriage
	would so shortly give the proper termination
(25) 	to the elopement, they might hope to conceal
	its unfavorable beginning, from all those who
	were not immediately on the spot.
	She had no fear of its spreading farther,
	through his means. There were few people on
(30) 	whose secrecy she would have more coddently
	depended, but at the same time, there
	was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's
	frailty would have mortified her so much. Not,
	however, from any fear of disadvantage from
(35) 	it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there
	seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had
	Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most
	honorable terms, it was not to be supposed
	that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a
(40) 	family, where to every other objection would
	now be added, an alliance and relationship of
	the nearest kind with the man whom he so
	justly scorned.
	From such a connection she could not
(45) 	wonder that he should shrink. The wish of
	procuring her regard, which she had assured
	herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not
	in rational expectation survive such a blow as
	this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she
(50) 	repented, though she hardly knew of what.
	She became jealous of his esteem, when she
	could no longer hope to be benefitted by it.
	She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed
	the least chance of gaining intelligence. She
(55) 	was convinced that she could have been happy
	with him, when it was no longer likely they
	should meet.

          <b>Questions 16-24 are based on the following
passage.</b>
        </p>
        <p xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" />
        <pre xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">A fertilized female tarantula lays from 200
	to 400 eggs at a time; thus it is possible for a
	single tarantula to produce several thousand
Line 	young. She takes no care of them beyond
(5) 	weaving a cocoon of silk to enclose the eggs.
	After they hatch, the young walk away, find
	convenient places in which to dig their burrows
	and spend the rest of their lives in solitude.
	Tarantulas feed mostly on insects and
(10) 	millipedes. Once their appetite is appeased,
	they digest the food for several days before
	eating again, Their sight is poor, being limited
	to sensing a change in the intensity of light
	and to the perception of moving objects. They
(15) 	apparently have little or no sense of hearing,
	for a hungry tarantula will pay no attention to
	a loudly chlrping cricket placed in its cage
	unless the insect happens to touch one of
	its legs.
(20) 	But all spiders, and especially hairy ones,
	have an extremely delicate sense of touch.
	Laboratory experiments prove that tarantulas
	can distinguish three types of touch: pressure
	against the body wall, stroking of the body
(25) 	hair and riffling of certain very fine hairs on
	the legs called trichobothria Pressure against
	the body, by a finger or the end of a pencil,
	causes the tarantula to move off slowly for a
	short distance. The touch excites no defensive
(30) 	response unless the approach is from above,
	where the spider can see the motion, in which
	case it rises on its hind legs, lifts its front legs,
	opens its fangs and holds this threatening posture
	as long as the object continues to move.
(35) 	When the motion stops, the spider drops back
	to the ground, remains quiet for a few seconds,
	and then moves slowly away.
	The entire body of a tarantula, especially
	its legs, is thickly clothed with hair. Some of it
(40) 	is short and woolly, some long and stiff,
	Touching this body hair produces one of two
	distinct reactions. When the spider is hungry,
	it responds with an immediate and swift
	attack. At the touch of a cricket's antennae the
(45) 	tarantula seizes the insect so swiftly that a
	motion picture taken at the rate of 64 frames
	per second shows only the result and not the
	process of capture. But when the spider is not
	hungry, the stimulation of its hairs merely
(50) 	causes it to shake the touched limb. An insect
	can walk under its haq belly unharmed.
	The trichobothria, very fine hairs growing
	from disklike membranes on the legs, were
	once thought to be the spider's hearing organs,
(55) 	but. we now know that they have nothing to do
	with sound. They are sensitive only to air
	movement, A light breeze makes them vibrate
	slowly without disturbing the common hair.
	When one blows gently on the trichobothria,
(60) 	the tarantula reacts with a quick jerk of its four
	front legs. If the front and hind legs are stimu-
	lated at the same time, the spider makes a sudden
	jump. This reaction is quite independent
	of the state of its appetite.
(65) 	These three tactile responses--to pressure
	on the body wall, to moving of the common
	hair, and to flexing of the trichobothria-are
	so different from one another that there is no
	possibility of confusing them. They serve the
(70) 	tarantula adequately for most of its needs and
	enable it to avoid most annoyances and dmgers.
	But they fail the spider completely when
	it meets its deadly enemy, the digger wasp
	Pepsis.</pre>
