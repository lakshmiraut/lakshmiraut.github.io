	and arrangement of circumstances not only
	has occurred in the past, but will also be
5	repeated indefinitely in the future. This notion
	is based on the fact that time is infinite while
	matter is finite. Since objects in the world are

	there must be a limited number of possible
10	combinations of them, which over the course
	of infinite time must inevitably repeat.

          <b>Questions 10-16 are based on the following passage.</b>
        </p>
        <i xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">This passage is excerpted from a scientific article about the effect of the atmosphere on the weather.</i>
        <pre xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">line	Understanding the atmosphere is essential to
	meteorology because the weather, as well as
	the Earth's overall climate, is contingent on
	atmospheric conditions. The Earth's
5	multilayered atmosphere is an odorless,
	colorless mixture of gases and foreign
	particles. These include oxygen, nitrogen,
	water vapor, dust, salt, and chemicals.
	Although the atmosphere extends nearly 435
10	miles above the Earth, about 99 percent of
	the atmosphere's mass lies within
	approximately 20 miles of the Earth's
	surface. Proportionally, the atmosphere is
	about as thick on the Earth as a peel is on an
15 	apple. Nevertheless, life on Earth would
	cease to exist without it.
	The atmosphere sustains life on this planet in
	two major ways. First, it provides oxygen
	and water in the form of precipitation.
20 	Second, it shields us from the Sun's harmful
	rays. Heat from the Sun reaches our
	atmosphere through radiation - the invisible
	transfer of heat by rays of varying
	wavelengths. The atmosphere permits only
25	about 50 percent of this solar radiation to
	reach the Earth's surface. The rest is
	absorbed by the atmosphere or reflected
	back into space. Gases such as carbon
	dioxide function like the glass panes in a
30	greenhouse, retaining some of the heat
	energy that is then dispersed through the air.
	Almost all significant weather occurs just
	above the ground in the troposphere, the
	lowest layer of the atmosphere. The
35	troposphere rises about 10 miles above the
	equator and 5 miles above the North and
	South Poles. It is in continuous movement,
	due to the huge disparity between the
	amountof solar heat received at the equator
40	and that received at the poles. At the equator
	and the nearby tropics, where the weather is
	warmest, the air is hot and rises. In the
	Northand South Poles, where the weather is
	frigid, the cold air sinks. As a result, warm air
45 	travels to the poles and cold air flows to the
	equator.
	This circulation of cold and warm air creates
	patterns of prevailing winds that are divided
	into three zones. At the poles, the cold
50 	windsare known as the polar easterlies; at
	the middle-latitudes, the warm, moist winds
	are referred to as westerlies; in the tropics,
	the winds are called the northeasterly and
	southeasterly trade winds. These six wind
55 	belts move through the atmosphere in
	different directions. Their movement is
	affected by collisions with one another, the
	rotation of the Earth, and topographical
	features such as mountains and oceans. In
60 	addition, there are narrow bands of westerly
	winds that travel at high-altitude and move
	sofast - sometimes surpassing 200 miles an
	hour - that they are called jet streams.
	Overall, the troposphere is in constant, often
65 	turbulent, motion. This is why weather
	conditions throughout the Earth vary so
	greatly.
	Weather is influenced by three central
	atmospheric changes: the wind patterns
70 	discussed above and the atmosphere's
	temperature and moisture content.
	Meteorologists record changes in the
	atmosphere and then predict how these
	changes will affect the weather. For example,
75 	meteorologists frequently speak of
	atmospheric pressure, the pressure on the
	Earth from the weight of the atmosphere. Air
	masses (also known as "systems") are large
	bodies of air that form over oceans or land.
80 	In high-pressure systems, the cool, dry air is
	heavy and sinking. In low-pressure systems,
	the warm, moist air is light and rising. Rising
	atmospheric pressure tends to produce
	calm, clear weather, whereas falling
85 	atmospheric pressure will more likely result in
	cloudy, wet weather. When these dissimilar
	air masses collide at boundaries called
	"fronts," storms often ensue.</pre>

        </p>
        <i xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">The following passage is an excerpt from an article on rare book trading.</i>
        <pre xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">line 	A troubled silence fell over the London
	literary world in October of 1934. The
	source was a single book, An Enquiry into
	the Nature of Certain Nineteenth-Century
5 	Pamphlets, written by two booksellers, John
	Carter and Graham Pollard. They were
	unlikely detectives, but this is how the world
	remembers them as the men who
	uncovered one of the greatest frauds in the
10	history of the rare book market.
	The buying and selling of rare books was a
	phenomenon that first emerged in the
	nineteenth century. First editions of books by
	famous authors, the very first copies printed,
15	began to sell for hundreds and thousands of
	dollars to collectors in Europe and America.
	To a large extent this hobby, in its infancy,
	was encouraged by Thomas J. Wise, a
	collector of rare books and the proprietor of
20	the famous Ashley Library. A friend of the
	poet Robert Browning and a presiding officer
	at both the Percy Shelley and Browning
	Societies in London, Wise enjoyed an
	unblemished reputation among fellow
25	collectors and booksellers in London.
	Imagine, then, the surprise of his longtime
	friends and business associates when An
	Enquiry into the Nature of Certain
	Nineteenth-Century Pamphlets suggested
30	that the famous London literary man had
	faked most of the rare manuscripts that he
	had collected and sold for many thousands of
	pounds. Carter and Pollard, through a careful
	analysis of fonts and paper quality, proved
35	that one of Wise's "first editions" (of
	Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Sonnets from
	the Portuguese) could not have been
	printed in 1847, during the poet's lifetime.
	They dated it to no earlier than the 1880s, by
40	which time Browning had already been dead
	for several years. Wise had sold at least 10
	copies of these sonnets to unsuspecting
	collectors in the first decade of the twentieth
	century. Furthermore, the evidence
45 	suggested that about 50 additional works
	collected and sold by Wise were "in doubt"
	and could have been possible forgeries.
	In the wake of the scandal, the question for
	many was how Wise had managed to avoid
50 	detection as a forger for most of his lifetime.
	Wise's biographer and former protege,
	Wilfred Partington, attributed Wise's success
	to his particular method of forging. Instead of
	duplicating a manuscript that already existed,
55 	he created new "first editions" previously
	unknown to the world, and he used his
	reputation as a friend of Browning and a
	London literary man to put these fakes on the
	market. The works he produced could not
60 	be compared with any authentic edition; thus
	no trained eye could look for discrepancies
	between the real version and the fake one.
	Wise attempted to defend himself against the
	accusations but to no avail. The scientific
65 	evidence against him was considered
	conclusive by his former associates and
	friends. The scandal caused him to withdraw
	from public life, and he died less than a
	decade later. The Ashley Library, which
70 	Wise had spent most of his lifetime building,
	was largely dispersed and sold to pay his
	debts. He had originally intended to leave the
	library to the British Museum in its entirety,
	but so much doubt had been cast upon
75 	Wise's reputation as a rare book collector
	that the library was estimated by appraisers
	to be largely worthless.
	The discovery of Wise's forgery made
	collectors forever suspicious of heretofore
80 	unknown "first editions" that suddenly
	appeared on the market. In the longer run,
	the consequences of the work of the two
	literary "detectives" did nothing less than
	popularize the use of technology to evaluate
85 	the authenticity of rare manuscripts.</pre>
