<H2>Exercises for an easy start with Sas</H2>
<UL>
<LI>(Exercise 1) Using an introductory SAS manual(which I highly recommend you to purchase), 
learn how to create SAS datasets,
and do statistical analysis. First exercise is to create a small sas
program that can input data on three variables, y, x1, x2 (you provide
some arbitrary numbers for those variables) and then print the dataset,
and also run a regression of y on x1, x2. Here is a good starting point
sas example.  In this example you will see how to create temporary sas
datasets, merge two datasets, get descriptive statistics, run
regressions, obtain frequency distribution. These are explained in the
source code of the program file example1.sas.  How to run sas under
windows or unix is not explained here.  For a really short introduction 
that I wrote some time ago about how
to run SAS under unix follow this url:

<BR>
<LI><A HREF="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~lakshmi/Courses/SAS_rltd/example1.txt" >Example1.txt 
(save it as example1.sas)</A> 

<P>
In case you do not have an introductory SAS manual, I have kept here pdf file of
<A HREF="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~lakshmi/Courses/SAS_rltd/sas_ps.pdf" > An introduction to SAS System 
</A> by Phil Specter, UC Berkeley, which is also available from the internet. 
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>(Exercise 2) Do project 1, but first create a file containing the
data, <A HREF="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~lakshmi/Courses/SAS_rltd/example2.txt"
>click here for such an Example2.txt (save it as example2.sas)</A> and
for the dataset of this example2.sas <A
HREF="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~lakshmi/Courses/SAS_rltd/rawdat.txt" >click here
</A> (save it as rawdat.txt) (Believe it or not, it works fine on my computer).

<P>
After that write a SAS program in another file which can read that permanent data, do other data steps and 
and run the regression and other procedures. For an example of such a program
<A
HREF="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~lakshmi/Courses/SAS_rltd/example3.txt" >click here
</A> (save it as example3.sas)

<LI>(exercise 3) Use the master dataset above to do all your empirical project.  The exact problems that you have to analyze will come from the homework problems above.

<LI>(exercise 4) This exercise is for gplot,(nicer plot than the plot command).  This shows how to do overlay plots, i.e., multiple graphs on one plot.
