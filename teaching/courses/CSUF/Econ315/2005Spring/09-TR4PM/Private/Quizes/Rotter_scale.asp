Topic 0: Rotter's Locus of Control</h3>

<p>
<u><b>It does not matter if you obtain high or low score. The score of this 
survey is about your personality. This is not counted in your grade for this 
course..&nbsp; </b></u></p>

<p class="intro">This questionnaire assesses your opinions about certain issues. 
Each item consists of a pair of alternatives marked with a or b. Select the 
alternative with which you most agree. If you believe both alternatives to some 
extent, select the one with which you most strongly agree. If you do not believe 
either alternative, mark the one with which you least strongly disagree. Since 
this is an assessment of opinions, there are obviously no right or wrong 
answers. When you have finished the survey, you may have the computer score it 
for you.</p>

<p>A high score = External Locus of Control&nbsp; (maximum 23)<br>
A low score = Internal Locus of Control (minimum is 0)</p>
<p><b>Locus of Control </b>refers to the extent to which individuals believe 
that they can control events that affect them. Individuals with a high <i>
internal locus of control</i> believe that events result primarily from their 
own behavior and actions. </p>
