1.Let us denote by g_Y the growth rate GNP, by s the savings rate and v the output-capital ratio in an economy. The Harrod-Domar model of economic growth and development derived a simple formula linking savings rate to growth rate of GNP as follows:  
<i>g_Y = v s.</i>
Currently Bangladesh has a savings rate of 15 percent, the annual growth rate in total output is 5.0 percent per year and the population growth rate is 2.5%. The capital-output ratio<i> v</i> for Bangladesh is: 
<blockquote>
a. 1/2<br>
b.&nbsp; 2<br>
c. 3 <br>
d. 1/3 <br>
e. 4.

<td>2. Refer to the information about Bangladesh in question above. Bangladesh wants to increase the growth rate of total income  to 7% per year.  Assume that technology is not changing and there is no possibility of having foreign aid or foreign investment.  The economy of Bangladesh follows a Harrod-Domar model.  Then Bangladesh has to
<blockquote>
a. Increase its R&D by 7%. <br>
b. Increase its savings to 21%. <br>
c. Increase its population growth rate by an appropriate percentage point. <br>
d. Decrease its population growth rate by an appropriate percentage point. <br>
e. None of the above.

3. Refer to the information about Bangladesh in question 1. Bangladesh wants to increase 
its&nbsp; growth rate of per capita income  to 4.5% per year.  Assume that there is no possibility of having foreign aid or foreign investment.  The economy of Bangladesh follows a Harrod-Domar model.  Then Bangladesh has to
<blockquote>
a. Increase its R&D so that the output-capital ratio is increased to 7/15. <br>
b. Increase its savings to 21%.<br>
c. Decrease its population growth rate 0.5% per year. <br>
d. All of the above. <br>
e. Neither of the above.

4. Lewis model of economic development (the simplified version that is presented in the class and in the text book) is a better model of economic development than the Harrod-Domar model, because 
<blockquote>
a. Lewis model can generate growth in output forever when labor force stopped growing.<br>
b. Lewis model models labor absorption process but not the Harrod-Domar model.<br>
c. Because Lewis got Nobel prize but Harrod-Domar did not.<br>
d. All of the above.<br>
e. None of the above.

5.  Suppose people are allowed to invest abroad and the foreigners are allowed to invest in the less developed country that we are studying. Suppose the rate of return from a dollar invested in the US is 5% but in the developing country under consideration is 3%.  According to Lewis model, what should government do
<blockquote>
a. Introduce higher income tax. <br>
b. Introduce ban on capital flight.<br>
c. Government should go to the agriculture and persuade people to migrate to the urban sector.<br>
d. Seek out foreign capital investment.<br>
e. All of the above.

6. In the Lewis model of economic development,

a. The role of the rural sector is to provide labor required in the manufacturing sector. <br>
b.  Provide capital to have faster labor absorption in the manufacturing sector. <br>

7. One advantage of Lewis model is that it could be used to understand the 
process of<blockquote>
a. industrial R&amp;D that a firm may undertake.<br>
b. labor migration from the subsistence agricultural sector to the industrial 
modern sector<br>
c. All of the above. <br>
