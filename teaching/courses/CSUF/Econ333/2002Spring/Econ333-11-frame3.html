<ol>
  <li>(5/8/02)&nbsp; Each of you is required to see me for 5 minutes or so in my
    office (LH-408A) during my office hours this week or next week (Wed/Thurs
    5:00-7PM)&nbsp; but before your presentation of the paper.&nbsp; During the
    meeting, please tell me what you have been doing on the project.&nbsp;
    Failure to do so will result in non-acceptable paper and presentation.&nbsp;
    <font size="4" color="#FFFF00"><blink>Please make a note of this.</blink></font>
  </li>
  <li>
    <hr>
    <p>&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF">(4/14/02)
    URGENT and IMPORTANT: Please make sure&nbsp; that you bring&nbsp;<br>
    Scantron Form No.
    F-288-ERI-L.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    It is different from the one announced earlier.&nbsp; The earlier form
    cannot be read by our machine.&nbsp; Please make a note of this.</font>
  </li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000"><blink><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">(4/10/02)</span></blink>
    </font>Please redo the Self-Graded Homework#5 which has been changed to the
    current form because some of the questions in the earlier version that I
    took from the study guide of the book were vague.&nbsp; Please note that Q6.
    has one less choice now. Please also do the Homework#6 online by the due
    date.&nbsp; The due dates for both of them is now changed to 11:59PM April
    14.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000"><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">(4/10/02)</span><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
    For your Exam on April 17, please bring Scantron Form No. 882-E. There will
    be no office hours on Wednesday and Thursday because of my surgery.&nbsp;
    Instead, there will be office hours on Monday, April 15, between 2-6PM.</span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>(3/21/02) Your grades are posted.</li>
  <li>(3/6/02) All the materials covering today's class is posted in the
    Restricted Area. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><font color="#FF0000">The
    self-graded home work#3 is&nbsp; due online before                          11:59PM, March 11, 2002).&nbsp;</font>
    </span>This home work is Graded. Make sure you get all your answers written
    on the hardcopy and then type them on the computer.&nbsp; You will have only
    one chance (the first time you press the Grade It button) to register your
    grade.&nbsp; After you press the Grade it button, you can use the go back
    button and retype the answers that you got wrong.&nbsp; By few trial errors,
    you will be able to get all the correct answers.&nbsp; It is for this
    reason, I will not be able to give you another opportunity to resubmit the
    same homework that you already submitted.&nbsp; It will not be fair to those
    students who really got the answers right.&nbsp; If you do not feel
    comfortable submitting it online the very first time you can come to me with
    your answers on the hardcopy, and I will show you how to do it.&nbsp; Good
    luck!!!</li>
  <li>(3/05/02) <font color="#FFFFFF">The
    classroom change:&nbsp; The new class room is UH206, starting March 6, 2002
    class.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><font color="#00FFFF">(2/27/02)</font> All the exams are incremental,
    i.e., based on material covered after the previous exam.</li>
  <li><font color="#00FFFF">(2/27/02)</font> The first mid-term is rescheduled
    to be held on March 13, instead of the original date of March 6.</li>
  <li>(<font color="#00FFFF">2/27/02)</font> The online homework is due on or
    before March 11, 2002 (mid-night California time).&nbsp; You can submit it
    only after the class of March 6 when the materials of Chapter 5 of the book,
    on which material the self-graded home work is based,&nbsp; are reviewed in
    the class.&nbsp; The next class also review the Harrod-Domar model and Lewis
    model.&nbsp; The first mi-term is based on all these materials.</li>
  <li>Now you can register your password and start using the restricted material
    and homework.&nbsp; Make sure that you do not submit any homework until you
    have got all the answers typed.&nbsp; DO NOT press return because that may
    also submit your incomplete home work.&nbsp; When done, press the Key at the
    bottom Grade It or Submit It.&nbsp; VERY IMPORTANT, you can submit your
    homework only once, and once submitted, the grade you got will be posted.&nbsp;
    <font color="#00FFFF">The best practice is to first print the homework,
    write down your answers on it, and then go to the computer to fill in the
    answers and then press Grade it.</font></li>
