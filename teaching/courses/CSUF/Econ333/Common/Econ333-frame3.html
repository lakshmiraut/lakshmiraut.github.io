  part of the project. Those who missed, please talk to those who
  figured out what to do, and also you can talk to the students
  in the other class who may know how to do it. But in any case,
  if you did not come to see me today as you were asked to do or
  if you could not find it out from your other class mates, please
  wait on the second part of the paper until we meet again after
  the break. I am sorry for it all, but this is something not under
  my control, and I have to go to India without much advance notice.</FONT>
