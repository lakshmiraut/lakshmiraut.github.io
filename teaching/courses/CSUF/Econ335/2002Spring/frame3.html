<ol>
  <li>(5/8/02)&nbsp; Each of you is required to see me for 5 minutes or so in my
    office (LH-408A) during my office hours this week or next week (Wed/Thurs
    5:00-7PM)&nbsp; but before your presentation of the paper.&nbsp; During the
    meeting, please tell me what you have been doing on the project.&nbsp;
    Failure to do so will result in non-acceptable paper and presentation.&nbsp;
    <font size="4" color="#FFFF00"><blink>Please make a note of this.</blink></font></li>
  <li>
    <hr>
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF">(4/14/02)
    URGENT and IMPORTANT: Please make sure&nbsp; that you bring&nbsp;<br>
    Scantron Form No.
    F-288-ERI-L.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    It is different from the one announced earlier.&nbsp; The earlier form
    cannot be read by our machine.&nbsp; Please make a note of this.</font>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The second
    Mid-term is based
    on Chapters 4, 7, and 8 of the Textbook, PL.</font></p>
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000"><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">(4/10/02)</span><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
    For your Exam on April 18, please bring Scantron Form No. 882-E. There will
    be no office hours on Wednesday and Thursday because of my surgery.&nbsp;
    Instead, there will be office hours on Monday, April 15, between 2-6PM.</span></font>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>(3/19/02)&nbsp; Scores are posted. Please also check where you stand by
    clicking on the exam scores of everyone link.</li>
  <li>(<font color="#FF00FF">3/6/02) Important
    announcemen</font>t.&nbsp; You will have only one chance (the
    first time you press the Grade It button) to register your grade.&nbsp;
    After you press the Grade it button, you can use the go back button and
    retype the answers that you got wrong.&nbsp; By few trial errors, you will
    be able to get all the correct answers.&nbsp; It is for this reason, I will
    not be able to give you another opportunity to resubmit the same homework
    that you already submitted.&nbsp; It will not be fair to those students who
    really got the answers right.&nbsp; If you do not feel comfortable
    submitting it online the very first time you can come to me with your answers
    on the hardcopy, and I will show you how to do it.&nbsp; Good luck!!!</li>
  <li>(2/28/02) The first mid-term exam is rescheduled to be on March 14, 2002
    instead of the original date of March 7, 2002.</li>
  <li>The first homework is due online (or bring it to the class and then submit
    online after the class in my office or classroom computer) by <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><font color="#FF0000">10:00PM,
    March 7, 2002.</font></span></li>
  <li>Now you can register your password and start using the restricted material
    and homework.&nbsp; Make sure that you do not submit any homework until you
    have got all the answers typed.&nbsp; DO NOT press return because that may
    also submit your incomplete home work.&nbsp; When done, press the Key at the
    bottom Grade It or Submit It.&nbsp; VERY IMPORTANT, you can submit your
    homework only once, and once submitted, the grade you got will be
    posted.&nbsp; <font color="#00FFFF">The best practice is to first print the
    homework, write down your answers on it, and then go to the computer to fill
    in the answers and then press Grade it.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">(2/8/02)</span>
    </font>My web site got some troubles, it is under repair.&nbsp; You can see
    the unrestricted materials only at the moment.</li>
