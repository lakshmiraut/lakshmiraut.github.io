    <LI>(10/11/01)IMPORTANT!!&nbsp; I know some of you may have troubles
      submitting homework online from home.&nbsp; You have two choices.&nbsp;
      First, you can do it on paper and bring it to the class and enter your
      answer during the break or after the class is over so that if anything
      goes wrong, I can take care of it.&nbsp; Second choice, you can do it from
      wherever you would like to, but I will not be able to reset your score for
      you to be able to resubmit it for any reason. In&nbsp; either case, if you
      did not submit your answers before the deadline, it will NOT BE POSSIBLE
      for me to reset your score so that you can submit it late.
    <LI>(10/11/01)&nbsp; About the attendance, please let me remind you that I
      may take the attendance at random times and days, and now on there will be
      no partial credit even if you were in the class part of the day and absent
      during the roll call.
    <LI>(10/8/01) <font color="#00FF00"><blink>IMPORTANT!!</blink>&nbsp;</font>
      If you have not posted your answers to homework #3 by due date, you are
      automatically given a zero. I am sorry, but to be fair to others, it is
      not possible to reset it this time. Please do the next one on-time.
    <LI>(10/8/01) Please use the discussion forum on the Course Main page to
      post interesting questions, comments and also reply to the posted
      questions there. You will get credits (which I will really use if you are
      near the cut-off point of a grade) for participating and especially for
      posting interesting questions and answers. Look at the left panel.<br>
      <br>
      There is already an interesting question posted by one of your colleagues.
      I am waiting to see any good response to it.&nbsp;
      <hr>
    <LI>(10/4/01) The last two problems are dropped from homework that&nbsp; I
      handed out in the class.&nbsp; Please make a note of it. There is
      something wrong with the lat diagram.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <LI>(9/24/01) Scores for first mid-term exam are posted.
    <LI>(9/19/01) Please make note, especially those missed the last class, that
      the exam will be based on the material from chapter 1-3 of the text book
      and the material covered in the class.&nbsp; There are some lecture
      supplements for the mid-term and the power-point handouts all posted last
      week on the course restricted page site.&nbsp; I am here this week.&nbsp;
      So you can see me before the exam during the usual office hours.&nbsp;
      Good luck.
    <LI>(9/13/01) Please note that the new deadline for the second homework is
      September 19 mid-night instead of September 20 that I announced
      earlier.&nbsp; This way, after you submit your homework, you can practice
      to correct your mistakes.
    <LI>(9/12/01)Today's office hour shifted to tomorrow 3:00-5:00.
    <LI><FONT COLOR="#00ffff">9/6/01) The homework based on chapter 3 is not
      due until September 20th (Mid-night). &nbsp; </FONT> 
    <LI><FONT COLOR="#00ffff">You can select your password on-line until
      August 31st just by clicking on [login] on the left panel.&nbsp; After
      August 31st, please see me.&nbsp; You <b><u><font size="4"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">must
      </span></font></u></b>have your password to have access to the restricted
      material and submission of your self-graded home works. </FONT>
