taught graduate and undergraduate economics courses at University of
California-San Diego, University of Hawaii-Manoa, Yale University and California
State University at Fullerton. I built these course pages when I was
teaching prior to joining the US Social Security
Administration in 2005.&nbsp; I built these pages using <span style="text-decoration: underline;">serverside
programming with ASP</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and a backend database</span>
to serve student specific
course materials to my students.&nbsp; You may go through various
course pages. You will be able to see only the public materials like
syllabus and sometimes homework.&nbsp;&nbsp; In future when I teach
again, I will upgrade these using contemporary&nbsp; IT technology
and&nbsp; textbooks.&nbsp; This site&nbsp; does not have links to the
courses I taught at the University of California-San Diego, as the capable IT facilities were not available at
that time. </big></big><big><big><br>
