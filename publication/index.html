      <p>This paper studies factors that affect enrollment onto a public insurance program such as the Social Security’s DI (Disability Insurance) program and SSI (Supplemental Security Income) program, and the competing risk of death before disability enrollment by age 65. As individuals age, or misuse drugs, alcohols or intake less nutrient foods, the homeostatic regulatory mechanism that controls physiological body systems such as respiratory, cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, immune, and metabolic becomes more and more frail in its ability to face internal and external stressors. This leads to one-or-comorbid chronic diseases (such as diabetes, cancer, vascular, musculoskeletal, cognitive and mental disorders), DI-qualifying disabilities or death. The speed of progression through these health states depends on the rate of depletion of one’s homeostatic health and frailty levels. Genetic and epigenetic factors comprised of internal and external environments, health care use, health related behavior and cognitive endowments modulate the depletion rate of homeostatic health over life cycle. These, in turn, determine the likelihood of various pathways through the health states. I use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data to estimate a multi-state time-to-event model of pathways through these health states. I use bio-markers such as BMI, CES-D, measures of cognitive health, and indicators of health related behaviors such as smoking, exercising and use of preventative care along the life-course as indicators of latent homeostatic health and frailty levels and how they affect the risks of following various pathways to disability or death before reaching age 65.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <a href="/publication/2020-01-01_health_outcomes_in_m/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Health outcomes such as serious diseases, disability and death develop sequentially over one’s life span. Genetic and epigenetic factors, and health related behaviors throughout one’s life condition those health outcomes. Some individuals develop one or more diseases and their health deteriorate faster, worsening their quality of lives and survival probabilities. The models in health economics literature formulate progression of health outcomes over the life span using the multistate time to event framework, and estimate the effects of the above mitigating factors on probability of transitions from one health state to another. The sequential nature of health progression is captured in the Markovian structure. Markov chain models have short memory, i.e., these models assume that given the current health outcome, the past does not influence the probability of transition to another health outcome. Many chronic diseases such as cancers and heart diseases manifest as a result of long lagged past health behaviors. Markov chain models are limited in capturing these effects. More recently, long short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) models are developed in the machine (deep) learning literature that keep track of important features from the past inputs in its memory cells, which the model determine important in the ‘context’ of the future outcomes. These models are generally applied to natural language processing, creating audio streams, and video subtitling. In this paper, I adapt the existing LSTMRNN models for the prediction of sequential health outcomes in midages. I first compare the merits and shortcomings of these two approaches and then use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data to compare their performances in predicting sequential health outcomes.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Children from disadvantaged families perform very poorly in school and labour market because they acquire low level of social, motivational and cognitive skills during their early childhood development. Using the NLSY data set, this paper formulates and then estimates the production processes for cognitive skills and non-cognitive skills such as social and motivational skills during early childhood development and the long-term effects of these skills on learning and lifetime earnings of an individual. Using these estimated relationships, the paper provides a calibrated intergenerational altruistic model of parental investment in children’s preschool. This dynamic model is then used to estimate the effects of publicly provided preschool to the children of poor socioeconomic status (SES) as a social contract on lifetime earnings distribution, intergenerational college and social mobility, and to estimate the tax burden of such a social contract.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>The paper extends the Samuelsonian overlapping generations framework to encompass a variety of altruistic preferences, recasting it into a Lindahl equilibrium framework. It has been shown that altruism towards parents provides an alternative answer to the basic question of capital theory as to why interest rates are positive. It is shown that a sufficiently strong altruism towards parents can change a Pareto inefficient Samuelsonian economy with negative interest rate to an efficient classical economy with positive interest rate. Based on Sen’s meta ranking concept, the paper proposes an ethical principle to supplement the equilibrium theory for guiding agents in their choice of the degree of altruism towards their parents.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>This article explores the causes of growth in the number of disabled workers on the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) rolls from 1980 through 2010 by estimating the probability of a DI beneficiary&rsquo;s program exit because of recovery, death, or conversion to retired-worker beneficiary, by sex, age, and disability type. Using Social Security administrative data and a competing-risks model to estimate DI exit probabilities, I find that death is the primary reason for program exits among nearly all beneficiary subgroups during their first 9 years on the rolls. Relative to men, women have lower probabilities of exit because of death; younger women also have lower exit probabilities because of recovery. From the 1980s to the 1990s, the probability of exit because of death declined while the probability of exit because of recovery did not improve. Beneficiaries with certain impairments are noteworthy exceptions to these general outcomes.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>The growing income inequality has been a big concern for economists and policy makers around the world. Many factors are responsible for the observed burgeoning income inequality, such as capital outflow, relocation of jobs, declining labor union, i.e., declining bargaining power of the labor, poor regulation of financial institutions, corruption, and all-encompassing globalization. Incomes of the bottom 99 percent population in a society comes mainly from earnings, and much of the earnings inequality results from the inequality of skill formation. The children of poor socioeconomic status stays behind skill accusations as compared to their rich counterpart. In modern technology-rich economies, providing high quality education to the talented individuals and matching their jobs with the highly productive technical sector is crucial for economic growth, earnings inequality and social mobility. Because education is used as a signal for a worker’s unobserved endowment of talents, its acquisition by various social groups distorts productive efficiency, lowers social mobility and increases earnings inequality. This paper provides a signaling equilibrium framework to study these issues.</p>

      <p>This paper formulates a model of the optimal export decision of private firms and then empirically studies the effect of firm size, R&amp;D activities, competitiveness and trade policies on export performance of Indian private firms during the period 1975–1986. India practised restrictive trade and industrial policies and introduced partial liberalization of trade policies in the early 1980’s to encourage exports. The paper argues that the Cragg model is more appropriate to model firms’ export behaviours under India’s restrictive trade policies than the commonly used Tobit model. The evaluation of the export promotion and partial import liberalization policies of 1980 based on the Tobit model is found to be qualitatively quite different from the evaluation based on the Cragg model. The LR and LM specification tests reject the Tobit model against the Cragg model in all specifications.</p>

      <p>Abstract This paper formulates a structural dynamic programming model of preschool investment choices of altruistic parents and then empirically estimates the structural parameters of the model using the NLSY79 data. The paper finds that preschool investment significantly boosts cognitive and non-cognitive skills, which enhance earnings and school outcomes. It also finds that a standard Mincer earnings function, by omitting measures of non-cognitive skills on the right-hand side, overestimates the rate of return to schooling. From the estimated equilibrium Markov process, the paper studies the nature of within generation earnings distribution, intergenerational earnings mobility, and schooling mobility. The paper finds that a tax-financed free preschool program for the children of poor socioeconomic status generates positive net gains to the society in terms of average earnings, higher intergenerational earnings mobility, and schooling mobility.</p>

      <p>The paper estimates the economic cost to family when a household member loses job due to onset of disability. The cost is measured in terms of loss in the ‘conversion handicap’ adjusted per capita household consumption and is estimated using the Indian National Sample Survey (NSS) data. Estimates of the loss are given by state, by rural-urban place of residence, and by the type of disability. The paper recommends a publicly provided actuarially fair social disability insurance program that taxes workers while working and provides disability benefits close to their pre-disability earnings to improve social welfare by preventing large consumption losses.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <a href="/publication/2010-01-01_economic_incentives_/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>This paper estimates the incentive effects of replacement rate (measured as the ratio of disability benefits to an estimate of potential earnings), non-employment and disability policies on the hazard rate of disability entitlements. The incentives are formulated in a dynamic programming model within a counting process framework and estimated using the one percent Continuous Work History Sample (CWHS) of the Administrative data on around 3 million individuals. The paper examines the argument that the widening income gap between the rich and the poor in the eighties created strong incentives for workers to get onto the rolls by raising the replacement rates of the poor. The paper finds that while the replacement rate of the poor grew rapidly in the eighties, its effect on enrollment was not strong. The paper also shows that the effect of non-employment on the likelihood of one’s getting onto the program depends on the health status of the worker: a healthier worker (as inferred from the proxy variable for health constructed in this paper using work history) has a much lower probability of getting onto the program than a worker with adverse health shocks. Among various disability policies, the addition of Medicare benefits contributed most to the growth of disability entitlements; the mental listings and broadening of coverage to musculoskeletal and mental disorders have significant positive effect and the D&amp;A and Welfare reforms have significant negative effect in explaining the pattern of disability entitlements in the 80’s and 90’s.</p>

While we find no independent effects of home ownership, there are positive significant effects of home environment, neighborhood quality, and residential stability on the reading and math performance of children between the ages of three and twelve. The main policy implication of our study is that improvement of a child&rsquo;s home environment, residential stability, and the quality of the neighborhood is more important than ownership of a home to achieve better child outcomes. Subsidized home ownership can lead to better child outcomes to the extent that it places a child in a better home environment, in a more stable residence, and in a better neighborhood.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <a href="/publication/2007-01-01_mortality_and_disabi/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Individuals develop adverse health conditions as they get older, which limit their earnings, resources, and well-being. Workers also face uncertainty about their life spans, which affect their savings and consumption decisions. Many well-known economic characteristics of these risks prevent private markets from pooling these risks adequately. Pay-as-you-go social insurance programs – by levying payroll taxes on workers and paying benefits to disabled workers, retirees, and survivors – can substitute for these missing markets. In addition to sharing these two types of risks, such programs will affect the aggregate capital stock, consumption, and the elderly poverty rate. This paper models the risk sharing and the aggregate effects using a calibrated stochastic overlapping generations general equilibrium model. The paper uses as a benchmark the stationary equilibrium of an economy in which individuals self-insure themselves against these risks by adjusting their own saving, and compares this benchmark to the stationary equilibriums of economies with simplified old-age insurance (OASI) and disability insurance (DI) programs, alone and in combination (OASDI). The representative worker’s lifetime welfare is computed in the benchmark and the alternatives. Optimal replacement rates for the model’s OASI and DI programs are also calculated. The main findings of the paper are that the OASI and DI programs in the model economy together improve the lifetime welfare of workers, reduce the variation of consumption and asset holdings over the life cycle, and virtually eliminate elderly poverty that may arise from these two sources of income shocks. The welfare-equivalent increase in consumption at all ages in the benchmark would be about 14 percent for the DI program alone or 11 percent for the combined programs. The OASI program in the model, however, does not improve individual well-being. This might be due to several factors. First, similar to other models in the literature, this model assumes that the accidental bequest of an individual is redistributed equally among living individuals, which effectively mimics an actuarially fair annuity market with some progressive redistribution. This undermines the annuity role of the OASI program. Second, the model disregards the survivors’ benefits components of the OASI program, which would increase the welfare of an individual from an increase in welfare of his survivors. The paper finds that the optimal replacement rate to be zero percent for the OASI program without the survivors’ benefit component and with equal sharing of unintended bequest, and the optimal replacement rate for the DI program to be 90 percent.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <a href="/publication/2005-01-01_parental_human_capit/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>This paper proposes two alternative models of intergenerational transfers linking parental investment in human capital of children to old-age support. The first model formulates these transfers as a pure loan contract and the second model as self-enforcing reciprocity. Both models predict neutrality of intergenerational redistribution of resources within the family, also known as the “difference in income transfer derivatives property”. Two models, however, provide different reasons for the failure of this property, and yield different policy implications for parental human capital investment and provision of old-age support. Specification tests on the Indonesian Family Life Survey data reject the pure loan model in favor of the reciprocity model. The estimated difference in income transfer derivatives for this data is found to be significantly higher than the difference estimated by Altonji, Hayashi and Kotlikoff Altonji et al. (1992) [Altonji, J.G., Hayashi, F. and Kotlikoff, L.J. (1992). Is the Extended Family Altruistically Linked? Direct Tests Using Micro Data.

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Imposing a group structure on the set of random orders, the paper reformulates and characterizes the random order value and more generally semi-value operators in a unified framework that encompasses games with finite and continuum of players and allows symmetry of the operators to be with respect to a subgroup of automorphisms. A set of orderings of players equipped with a group structure induced from the group structure of automorphisms together with a measure structure on it constitutes a group of random orders in the analysis. For finite games it is shown that given any fixed group of random orders, the linear operator on the whole space of games that assigns to each game its expected marginal contribution is symmetric with respect to the associated group of automorphisms if and only if the randomness of the group of orders is generated by a right invariant Haar measure; as a corollary, the paper provides a group theoretic proof for the existence and uniqueness of random order Shapley value and semi-value operators that are symmetric with respect to the full group of automorphisms; the paper also shows that the random order semi-value operators constructed from a proper subgroup of orders coincide with the semi-value operators which are symmetric with respect to the full group of automorphisms on a linear subpace of games. Many of these results are also extended to games with continuum of players.</p>

      <p>Using the NLSY data set, this paper formulates and then empirically estimates the production processes for social, motivational and cognitive skills during early childhood development and the long-term effects of these skills on learning and life-time earnings of an individual. Using these estimated relationships, the paper provides a calibrated intergenerational altruistic model of parental investment in children&rsquo;s preschool. This dynamic model is then used to estimate the effects of publicly provided preschool to the children of poor socioeconomic status (SES) on college mobility and intergenerational social mobility and to estimate the tax burden of such a social contract.</p>

      <p>This paper studies the effects of firm size, import of raw materials, import of capital goods, in-house R&amp;D investment, and competitiveness on exports of Indian private firm during 1975-1986. The paper finds that in-house R&amp;D investment and import of capital goods had limited effects on exports. The firm size, import of raw materials, and competitiveness had significant positive effects on exports of Indian firms. Since liberalization policies positively affect these variables, the partial liberalization policies of 1980 had positive effects on exports. The total effect on the economy was, however, limited because of the limited scope of those liberalization policies.</p>

      <p>The main purpose of this chapter is to examine the motive for investment by parents in the human capital of children. The difference between patterns of intergenerational transfers and investment in the human capital of children in developed countries on the one hand, and those of most of the developing countries on the other, is that while in all countries, parents invest substantial resources in the human capital of children, in less-developed countries we observe substantial resource transfers from children to parents but such transfers are much less observed in developed countries. These patterns of transfer are sometimes used to postulate the hypothesis that in less-developed countries, parental investment in their children is more like lending to children, since children cannot borrow from the private capital market to finance their education, whereas in developed countries, parental investment in their children is mainly due to parental altruism towards their children.</p>

      <p>In this paper we report results for a reformulated random order approach to values of non-atomic games. The reformulation is achieved by generating random orders from a fixed subgroup of automorphisms Theta that admits an invariant probability measurable group structure. The resulting Theta-symmetric random order value operator is unique and satisfies all the axioms of a Theta-symmetric axiomatic value operator. For the uncountably large invariant probability measurable group ( Theta, B, Gamma) of Lebesgue measure preserving automorphisms constructed in Raut [1997], Theta-symmetric random order value exists for most games in BV and it coincides with the fully symmetric Aumann-Shapley axiomatic value on large subspaces of games in pNA.

      <p>In this paper we consider an overlapping generations model with endogenous fertility and two-sided altruism and show the limitations of applying commonly used open loop Nash equilibrium in characterizing equilibrium transfers from parents to children in the form of bequest, and transfers from children to parents as voluntary old-age support. Since in our model children are concerned with parents’ old-age consumption, agents have incentives to save less for old age and to have more children so as to strategically induce their children to transfer more old-age support. We formulate such strategic behavior within a sequential multi-stage game and introduce a notion of learning equilibrium to characterize equilibrium manipulative behavior and then study the consequences of such strategic manipulations on private intergenerational transfers, fertility and savings decisions, and on Pareto optimality of equilibrium allocation. We show that the learning equilibrium notion of the paper simplifies computation of subgame perfect equilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium is the longrun outcome of dynamic learning equilibrium paths (this aids in selecting, sometimes, a unique equilibrium among multiple subgame perfect equilibria), and an open-loop Nash equilibrium involves ”incredible” threats from children. We provide an alternative explanation for the existence of publicly provided social security program and examine its role to correct distortions created by strategic manipulation.</p>

      <p>This paper constructs an increasing sequence of finite measurable subgroups of Lebesgue measure preserving (l.m.p.) automorphisms of the unit interval, and projective Borel homomorphisms of the subgroups. Then, by superimposing this group structure on the original Daniel-Kolmogorov model of stochastic processes it extends the DanielKolmogorov consistency theorem which enables the construction of a separated measurable projective limit group and its representation as an uncountably large subgroup of l.m.p. automorphisms. Each such automorphism induces a distinct ordering of the players in the unit interval. With respect to this group of random orders, and again using the extended consistency theorem, a formula for the unique random order value operator, proposed by Raut, (Indian Statistical Institute discussion paper no. 8108, 1981) and Raut (Random order approach to Shapley-value of games and Haar measure (mimeo), 1993, University of California-San Diego), is derived for economically important classes of scalar and vector measure valued games in pNA. The formula is seen to be identical to the axiomatic value formula of Aumann and Shapley (values of non-atomic games, 1974, Princeton University Press).</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Publisher Summary This chapter describes the framework of the models of economic growth with endogenous population. The chapter discusses the microeconomics of endogenous population: fertility, mortality, and investment in children. In the chapter,the aim of developing growth models with endogenous population is principally to explain why, as income grows, both birth and death rates fall, and stocks of both human and physical capital per capita increase over time.Review of existing neoclassical growth models with endogenous, but unspecified, population growth, suggests a wide variety of possibilities: multiple equilibria, some of which may be stable and others unstable, characterized by large populations with low per capita incomes or by small populations with high per capita income. Without knowing the ways in which population change is related to the stocks of capital, the level of population and other state variables of the economy, however, there is little to distinguish, which path may be followed.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>This paper demonstrates that an accelerated hazard framework is more appropriate than commonly used proportional hazard framework to model the timing of marriage and timing and spacing of children. Using the 1976 Malaysian Family Life Survey Data and selecting an appropriate duration model, the paper tests the old-age security and gender preference hypotheses and estimates the replacement effect. The paper finds strong evidence for the old-age support hypothesis: If parents have sufficient wealth to support themselves during their old-age, they have longer birth intervals; the Chinese have higher likelihood of depending on their children for old-age support than the Malays, and higher is the husband&rsquo;s earnings, the less likely is the couple&rsquo;s dependence on children for such support. The paper finds weak evidence for son preference hypothesis: The number of sons has no effect on the birth intervals of the Malays whereas it has significant negative effect up to three children for the Chinese. Regarding the replacement effect the paper finds that in response to a child death, parents like to have shorter durations up to fourth child and thereafter, the effect is not significant; the desired family size of the Chinese is higher than that of the Malays.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <a href="/publication/1995-01-01_signaling_equilibriu/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>This paper provides a model of intergenerational social mobility and economic growth, in which innate ability of workers, and the type of their education and jobs determine the rate of technological progress and social mobility. The innate ability and hence productivity level of an individual is private knowledge. Education not only increases productivity level, more so for the higher ability individuals, it also acts as a signaling device for one&rsquo;s innate productive ability for the purpose of job matching in the labor market. It is shown that in economies with one-time non-renegotiable wage contracts, there are generally multiple signaling equilibria, all being far away from generating the maximum attainable rate of social mobility and economic growth. There are no natural economic grounds that can guide to select a particular equilibrium. Various labor market practices such as quit, layoffs and promotions based on worker&rsquo;s or employer&rsquo;s subjective assessment of on-the-job realized productivity, or explicit wage contracts contingent on some publicly observed noisy measurement of realized productivity, can improve some of the inefficiencies, and hence increase the rate of economic growth and social mobility. The remaining inefficiencies, however, can only be removed by intervening in the education system. The paper analyzes briefly a few education systems, and within the dual private-public education system, the paper examines the role of school vouchers or subsidies to the children of poorer family backgrounds in improving the rate of economic growth and social mobility.</p>

      <p>We test the R &amp; D spillover hypothesis of the endogenous growth literature using panel data for a sample of private manufacturing firms in India over the period 1975–1986. We estimate an extended production function that includes the firm&rsquo;s own R &amp; D capital stock and the spillover effect of the industry-wide R &amp; D capital stock as inputs, as well as physical capital and labor hours. We specify models which eliminate three sources of estimation bias and flawed hypothesis tests: serially correlated errors, unobserved heterogeneity due to omitted factors of production, and endogenous determination of value-added and input levels. Several specification tests are used to select a well-behaved model. The final parameter estimates show evidence for the R &amp; D spillover hypothesis in all industries.</p>

      <p>Summary We present an overlapping generations model of endogenous fertility and growth. The cost of child rearing and the effect of population size on total factor productivity determine the dynamics of competitive equilibrium path of our model. The non-linear dynamics of the model generates a plethora of outcomes (depending on the functional forms, parameters and initial conditions) that include not only the neo-classical steady state with exponential growth of population with constant per capita income and consumption, but also growth paths which do not converge to a steady state and are even chaotic. Exponential, and even super exponential, growth of per capita output are possible in some cases.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Using pooled time series data across 15 major states of India, the relationships between measures of living standards and per capita income and government expenditures in social sectors are estimated. Female literacy, infant mortality, total fertility rates and level of poverty are taken as measures of living standards. Public expenditures on education, and improvement of medical facilities are found to be more effective in improving living standards than growth in income alone. In particular, the state of Kerala is not an outlier in its achievement of impressively higher living standards, relative to other states, after controlling for government expenditures in the social sectors. These conclusions do not change after controlling for fixed effects and with application of robust estimation procedures.</p>

      <p>In this paper we consider an overlapping generations model with endoge-nous fertility and two-sided altruism and show the limitations of applyingcommonly used open loop Nash equilibrium in characterizing equilibriumtransfers from parents to children in the form of bequest, and transfers fromchildren to parents as voluntary old-age support. Since in our model childrenare concerned with parents’ old-age consumption, agents have incentives tosave less for old age and to have more children so as to strategically inducetheir children to transfer more old-age support. We formulate such strategicbehavior within a sequential multi-stage game and use the notion of subgameperfect equilibrium to study the consequences of such strategic manipulationson private intergenerational transfers, fertility and savings decisions, and onPareto optimality of equilibrium allocation. We then examine the role ofsocial security to correct such strategic distortions.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>This paper studies the general equilibrium effects of various social security programs on the rates of population growth and capital accumulation within an overlapping generations framework with endogenous fertility and savings. It also shows that if the rate of intergenerational transfers of income from old to young or child care cost is low, a competitive equilibrium follows a path of over population and capital accumulation in a modified Pareto Optimal sense; a social security program in such a case is Pareto improving. A fully funded system is not neutral if it is financed by child - taxes. It also shows that unlike in the case of exogenous fertility where competitive equilibrium attains steady-state only asymptotically, when fertility is endogenous it may attain a unique globally stable steady state in finite time.</p>

      <p>This paper studies the intertemporal relationships among population growth, income distribution, inter-generational social mobility, skill composition of the labor force, and household income in an overlapping generations general equilibrium model that aggregates household decisions regarding fertility, savings and investment in human capital of children. It shows that as a consequence of endogenous fertility, the equilibrium path attains steady state from the second generation. Income tax transfer, child taxation, and social security taxation policies that can be devised to affect these variables are also analyzed. The model provides a structural explanation for the inverse household income-child quantity and negative child quality-quantity relationships that are observed in developing countries. It also shows that group interests may hinder the emergence of perfect capital markets with private initiatives.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>The determinants of savings generally and the specific effects of government policies on savings and consumption are pivotal forces in investment and economic growth. The Hall hypothesis states that consumption is a function of lifetime (“permanent”) income, rather than income in each period independently. Changes in interest and tax rates, money supply, or government expenditure will affect permanent income and hence consumption and savings only if they are unexpected and thus not already incorporated in the estimation of permanent income. We are unable to reject the Hall hypothesis in tests for developing countries when we allow for varying interest rates. We do find evidence of a negative effect of inflation on consumption, and a positive relationship between the real interest rate and consumption. The evidence for the Hall hypothesis also suggests that Ricardian equivalence may be valid—this is Barro&rsquo;s hypothesis that the effect on savings is the same whether government deficits are financed through taxation or debt. Our preliminary testing, however, does not support Ricardian equivalence.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>This paper develops a dynamic stochastic model to explain the observed pattern of R&amp; input choices of Indian private firms in terms of firm size, market structure, and science base. The inputs to the production of technological knowledge are taken to be in house R&amp; activities, and purchase of technology and know-how from foreign and domestic suppliers. The model is estimated with firm level data from light, petro-chemical, and heavy industries. In all three industries larger firms tend to substitute domestic for foreign purchase of technology and technical knowhow; and in heavy industry, larger firms also do more in-house R&amp;. Monopoly power of a firm in the light industry has no significant effect on its R&amp; activities; in the heavy industry, higher monopoly power to a firm reduces its purchase of technology, without affecting other R&amp; activities; in the petro chemical industry, higher monopoly power to a firm reduces its purchase of technology, but this but this reduction is partially offset by an increase in in-house R&amp; expenditures.</p>

      <p>Continuity of preferences imposes behavioral restrictions on the preferences such as impatience or myopia. This paper extends the notions of myopia due to Brown and Lewis, and their characterization of the Mackey topology in terms of myopia, from l to L. Then this characterization of the Mackey topology on L is used to extend Araujo&rsquo;s theorem on the necessity of impatience for the existence of competitive equilibrium from l to L.</p>
