  abstract = {The orderings of players on games with continum of players is generated with a group of automorpshims of the players set $[0,1]$. The axiomatic **semi-values** of games with continuum of players is reformulated using random orders, imposing a measurable group structure on the set of automorphisms.  The semi-value is characterized as a Haar measure on the measurable group.},
