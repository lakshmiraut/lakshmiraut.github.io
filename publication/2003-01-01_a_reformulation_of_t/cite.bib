  abstract = {In this paper the AumannShapley random order approach to values of nonatomic games is reformulated by restricting the set of random orders and the symmetry group to any subgroup of automorphisms that admits an invariant probability measurable group structure. It is shown that with respect to the uncountably large invariant probability measurable group of Lebesgue measure preserving automorphisms that is constructed in Raut, 1997, the random order value exists for most games in BV, and it coincides with the fully symmetric AumannShapley axiomatic value on pNA(mu). Thus by restricting the set of admissible orders suitably, the paper provides a possibility result to the AumannShapley Impossibility Principle.},
