  abstract = {Using techniques from the non-standard analysis, a non-standard analogue of the Aumann-Shapley random order value of non-atomic games is provided. The paper introduces the notion of effectively ergodic family of automorphism groups. It is shown that for a wide class of games, the non-standard random order value with respect to an effectively ergodic family of automorphism groups coincides with the standard Aumann-Shapley value.},
