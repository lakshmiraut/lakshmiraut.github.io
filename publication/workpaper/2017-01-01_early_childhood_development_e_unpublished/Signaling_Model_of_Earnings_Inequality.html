      The growing income inequality has been a big concern for economists and policy makers around the world. Many factors are responsible for the observed burgeoning income inequality, such as capital outflow, relocation of jobs, declining labor union, i.e., declining bargaining power of the labor, poor regulation of financial institutions, corruption, and all-encompassing globalization. Incomes of the bottom 99 percent population in a society comes mainly from earnings, and much of the earnings inequality results from the inequality of skill formation. The children of poor socioeconomic status stays behind skill accusations as compared to their rich counterpart. In modern technology-rich economies, providing high quality education to the talented individuals and matching their jobs with the highly productive technical sector is crucial for economic growth, earnings inequality and social mobility. Because education is used as a signal for a worker’s unobserved endowment of talents, its acquisition by various social groups distorts productive efficiency, lowers social mobility and increases earnings inequality. This paper provides a signaling equilibrium framework to study these issues.<br><strong>JEL Classifications:</strong> J62, O15.<br><strong>Keywords:</strong> Early Childhood Development, Social Mobility, Education Signaling Model.

The summarized literature below in psychology, economics and the recently emerging genetics and epigenetics of health, cognitive and noncognitive developments of children show that the most effective intervention for the children of poor SES should be introduced at the preschool stage so that these children are prepared for schools and colleges and better health.</p>
<!-- 
Children of poor SES perform poorly in skill acquisition and in the labor market. Many children of poor SES do not complete high school and many of them perform poorly in schools. Gaps in test scores between rich and poor children are substantial, and unequal schooling does little to widen this gap. In spite of its positive effects on test scores and earnings, the effects of improved school quality on school dropout rates is marginal.

Most earlier research in the last century focused on cognitive skills as the main determinant of socioeconomic behaviors, school performances and labor market outcomes. One line of influential but controversial research argues that poor parents have poor cognitive abilities and that is why they are poor; children of poor SES inherit poor cognitive abilities from their parents; thus very little can be done to improve the cognitive skills of the disadvantaged children, and hence their school performance and labor market outcomes, see @Herrnstein.Murray_1994_Book_epub and other references in @Plomin.Deary_2015. This view has been refuted using more appropriate data and statistical techniques. More recent research in neuroscience, psychology, economics and experimental game theory emphasize that it is the interplay of emotions and cognition that determine most social and economic behaviors [@Camerer.etal_2005;@Kahnem_2013_Book;@Winter_2014_Book].

In psychology literature, especially in the work of Bowlby (@Bowlby_1982), it has been argued that affect (emotion) dysregulation which begins to form immediately after birth, especially during the first two years of age, from low quality interaction of the primary care-taker (generally the mother) with the baby can have long lasting effects on emotional development of the child in later ages. @NICHD_NETWORK_2004 carried a longitudinal study and found evidence for such affect dysregulation mechanisms. The emotional dysregulation also conditions cognitive developments of children. More recent neurological research on this phenomena confirms this, see for instance, @Schore_2005.

Using the fMRI images of brain areas a number of neurological studies found that poverty has significant negative effects on development a child's certain areas of brain that are responsible for cognition, executive functions and emotions. For instance, a large scale neurological study by @Noble.etal_2015a found that family income significantly affects children's brain size, particularly in the surface area of the cerebral cortex that does most of the cognitive processing. See also their earlier study, @Noble.etal_2012 and the commentary in @Balter_2015. @Hair.etal_2015 conducted a large longitudinal neurological studies on children starting at an early age, and followed them up into their school years. They measured their scores on cognitive and academic achievements, and development of brain tissue, including gray matter of the total brain, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and hippocampus. They found significant negative effects of poverty on developments of these areas and on their academic achievements.

This view has been refuted using more appropriate data, statistical techniques and microbiological evidence.</p>
<p>It is the interplay of personality, emotion and cognition that determines most socioeconomic behaviors. Recent research in psychology, neurobiology, experimental game theory, and economics emphasize this. A branch of the psychology literature argues and empirically validates that the emotional intelligence is an important factor in socioeconomic decisions and behaviors—not the cognitive intelligence alone. Many definitions and measurements for emotional intelligence exit in the literature, however, the concept more relevant to our context is quoted from <span class="citation" data-cites="Mayer.etal_2004">Mayer, Salovey, and Caruso (<a href="#ref-Mayer.etal_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>, “{[Emotional Intelligence is the] capacity to reason about emotions, and of emotions to enhance thinking. It includes the abilities to accurately perceive emotions, to access and generate emotions so as to assist thought, to understand emotions and emotional knowledge, and to reflectively regulate emotions so as to promote emotional and intellectual growth”. <span class="citation" data-cites="Bar-On_2000 Goleman_2009_book">(<a href="#ref-Bar-On_2000" role="doc-biblioref">Bar-On 2000</a>; <a href="#ref-Goleman_2009_book" role="doc-biblioref">Goleman 2009</a>)</span> use somewhat broader definitions by including other personality traits in their definitions. It has been found that measures based on all these different definitions are highly correlated with each other and each explains strongly many socioeconomic behaviors independent of cognitive skills, (see <span class="citation" data-cites="Chakrabarti.Chatterje_2017_Book_ch2">Chakrabarti and Chatterjea (<a href="#ref-Chakrabarti.Chatterje_2017_Book_ch2" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> for some of these results in psychology and for a synthesis of various definitions, and <span class="citation" data-cites="Raut_2003b Heckman.Raut_2016">(<a href="#ref-Raut_2003b" role="doc-biblioref">Raut 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-Heckman.Raut_2016" role="doc-biblioref">Heckman and Raut 2016</a>)</span> for significant positive effects of non-cognitive skills on labor market earnings, independent of the effects of cognitive skills).</p>
<p>Group outcomes are generally more efficient than what individuals could do by themselves. Group activities to attain some common goal, however, require each member of the group to perform constant mind reading of the other members and evaluate how others may react to one’s action. The mechanism by which one reads other’s mind in a conflicting or cooperative situation is known in the psychology literature as theory of mind, a term introduced by <span class="citation" data-cites="Premack.Woodruff_1978">Premack and Woodruff (<a href="#ref-Premack.Woodruff_1978" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="Doherty_2008_Book">Doherty (<a href="#ref-Doherty_2008_Book" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> describes various mechanisms for the theory of mind. One who has better emotional intelligence and a better theory of mind can be more effective in a group, and can become the leader of the group. A group can have a higher level of group emotional intelligence and cognitive intelligence than another group, and can be more efficient and more productive as a result for many activities, <span class="citation" data-cites="Woolley.etal_2010">Woolley et al. (<a href="#ref-Woolley.etal_2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>. In experimental game theory such non-cognitive skills—emotional intelligence and theory of mind—play important role, <span class="citation" data-cites="Camerer.etal_2005 Kahnem_2013_Book Winter_2014_Book">(<a href="#ref-Camerer.etal_2005" role="doc-biblioref">Camerer, Loewenstein, and Prelec 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-Kahnem_2013_Book" role="doc-biblioref">Kahneman 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-Winter_2014_Book" role="doc-biblioref">Winter 2014</a>)</span>. The recent economics literature shows that non-cognitive skills such as socialization and motivation are also important for positive labor market outcomes, <span class="citation" data-cites="Deming_2017 Heckman.Raut_2016 Raut_2003b Maluccio.etal_2009">(<a href="#ref-Deming_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Deming 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-Heckman.Raut_2016" role="doc-biblioref">Heckman and Raut 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-Raut_2003b" role="doc-biblioref">Raut 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-Maluccio.etal_2009" role="doc-biblioref">Maluccio et al. 2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Where are these emotional intelligence or non-cognitive skills and the cognitive skills produced? For the effect of early childhood experiences, especially mother-child interactions, on the development of the theory of mind of the child, see <span class="citation" data-cites="Doherty_2008_Book Ruffman.etal_2002">(<a href="#ref-Doherty_2008_Book" role="doc-biblioref">Doherty 2008</a>; <a href="#ref-Ruffman.etal_2002" role="doc-biblioref">Ruffman, Slade, and Crowe 2002</a>)</span>. Another branch of the psychology literature, e.g.&nbsp;the work of <span class="citation" data-cites="Bowlby_1982">Bowlby (<a href="#ref-Bowlby_1982" role="doc-biblioref">1982</a>)</span>, argues that affect (emotion) dysregulation which begins to form immediately after birth, especially during the first two years of age, from low quality interaction of the primary care-taker (generally the mother) with the baby can have long lasting effects on emotional development of the child in later ages. <span class="citation" data-cites="NICHD_NETWORK_2004">NETWORK (<a href="#ref-NICHD_NETWORK_2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> carried a longitudinal study and found evidence for such affect dysregulation mechanisms. The emotional dysregulation also conditions cognitive developments of children. More recent neurobiology research on this phenomena confirms this, see for instance, <span class="citation" data-cites="Schore_2005">A. N. Schore (<a href="#ref-Schore_2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> and see <span class="citation" data-cites="Schore.Schore_2008">J. R. Schore and Schore (<a href="#ref-Schore.Schore_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> for a survey of this line of research. When parents are incapable of producing these skills, a good preschool program can be a good substitute for it.</p>
<p>Around the turn of the twenty-first century, a rapidly growing microbiology literature emerged, focusing on genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of personality, emotion and cognitive developments of individuals. The twenty-century microbiology research thought full DNA mapping of human genome will be able to uncover fully the mechanism of human development. But the research in this area fell short of explaining why identical twins diverge so much in their gene expressions or phenotypes as they progress through their lives. All cells in a body starting with the single fertilized egg have the same genetic mapping (i.e.,the same DNA sequence) throughout life. It is the epigenetic (literally means on top of genetic) codes, which are influenced by the internal and external environments of the body cells, indeed determine which genes are expressed, silenced, or mutated during cell divisions, and hence determine the development of the mind and body and their health status. For instance, stress of various kinds can have effects on epigenetic reprogramming of the plasticity of various parts of the brain that perform cognitive processing, language processing, emotion or affect regulations, the size and efficiency of the working memory and the long-term memory (see <span class="citation" data-cites="McEwen.Gianaros_2011">McEwen and Gianaros (<a href="#ref-McEwen.Gianaros_2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> for the effects of stress in general, <span class="citation" data-cites="Champagne.etal_2008">Champagne et al. (<a href="#ref-Champagne.etal_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Hellstrom.etal_2012">Hellstrom et al. (<a href="#ref-Hellstrom.etal_2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> for the effects of parenting practices, and <span class="citation" data-cites="Gluckman.etal_2008">Gluckman et al. (<a href="#ref-Gluckman.etal_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> for the effects of in utero environmental factors on cognitive and non-cognitive health developments). Other environmental factors such as the quality of language exposure, the presence of books, computers, musical instruments at home, the speech pattern, cognitive skills of mother and other care givers have also significant effects on the development of the neural network of the brain (i.e.,the network of dendrites, axons and synapses) specialized for language processing, creative writing or musical talents, <span class="citation" data-cites="Mezzacapp_2017 Murgatroyd.Spengler_2011">(<a href="#ref-Mezzacapp_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Mezzacappa 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-Murgatroyd.Spengler_2011" role="doc-biblioref">Murgatroyd and Spengler 2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>To look for microbiological evidence for the above, a number of recent neurological studies used fMRI images of brain areas for many individuals. They found that poverty has significant negative effects on the development of a child’s certain brain areas that are responsible for personality, emotion and executive functions. For instance, a large scale neurological study by <span class="citation" data-cites="Noble.etal_2015a">Kimberly G. Noble et al.

(<a href="#ref-Hair.etal_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> followed children starting at an early age up into their school years. They measured their scores on cognitive and academic achievements, and development of brain tissue, including gray matter of the total brain, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and hippocampus. They found significant negative effects of poverty on developments of these brain areas and on their academic achievements.</p>
<p>The vast literature above suggest that early age events have many lasting effects, as I mentioned earlier. In modern technology-rich economies, providing high quality education to the talented children and matching their jobs with the highly productive technical sector is crucial for economic growth, social mobility and earnings inequality. Individuals know their own abilities but the employers do not observe them. Employers use education as a predictor of a worker’s level of unobserved cognitive abilities. Because education acts as an imperfect predictor of one’s cognitive abilities, and children of poor SES have disadvantages of the type mentioned above in acquiring education, the individual investment in education in the economy distorts productive efficiency, lowers social mobility and increases earnings inequality. The paper will address these issues in a signaling model, adapting the asymmetric information frameworks of <span class="citation" data-cites="Stiglitz_1975">Stiglitz (<a href="#ref-Stiglitz_1975" role="doc-biblioref">1975</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Spence_1974_Book">A. M. Spence (<a href="#ref-Spence_1974_Book" role="doc-biblioref">1974</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: <!-- 
@sec-sec1 surveys the neuroscience research on the effect of poor socio economic status (SES) on early childhood development of cognitive skills, emotions and health, with their perpetuations to later stages of lives and thus creating inequalities of opportunities and capabilities right from birth.
--> <a href="#sec-sec2">Section&nbsp;2</a> describes the basic model of human capital acquisition in a signaling equilibrium framework. <a href="#sec-sec3">Section&nbsp;4</a> studies the properties of signaling equilibria specializing to the log-normal case and shows that the use of education as a signal accentuates earnings inequality and reduces social mobility. <a href="#sec-sec4">Section&nbsp;5</a> specializes the model to two schooling levels and two levels of unobserved cognitive ability and then studies the nature of equilibrium earnings inequality, social mobility and growth when children of poor SES are adversely affected in obtaining education.</p>

<p>The economy consists of an overlapping generations of agents and of risk neutral competitive producers. In each period there is a continuum of adult population, who live for one period. At the end of the period, he dies and a new adult child is born to each parent. Denote by <span class="math inline">\tau</span> an individual’s cognitive ability which affects his productivity at workplace and learning in school. I assume for simplicity that <span class="math inline">\tau</span> is one dimensional, and it takes a <span class="math inline">\mathcal{T}=(0,\infty )</span>. In the set <span class="math inline">\mathcal{T}</span>, a higher number denotes a greater level of cognitive ability. An individual’s productivity depends on his schooling level and his level of cognitive ability. The cost of schooling depends on his own schooling level, level of cognitive ability and his family background, denoted here with his parent’s schooling level <span class="math inline">s_{t-1}.</span> The level of schooling can be used to signal one’s productivity level. An individual chooses a schooling level <span class="math inline">s_{t}</span> which which together with his cognitive ability determine his productivity level, <em>productivity function</em> <span class="math inline">e(s,\tau ).</span> Possible education levels are assumed to be from the set <span class="math inline">\mathcal{S}=\left( 0,\infty \right)</span>, a higher number representing a higher education level.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I assume that the cognitive level <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}\in \mathcal{T}</span> of a child born to a parent of cognitive ability <span class="math inline">\tau _{t-1}</span> and schooling level <span class="math inline">s_{t-1}</span> follows probability distribution independent of <span class="math inline">\tau _{t-1}</span>and <span class="math inline">s_{t-1},</span> which is characterized by the pdf <span class="math inline">g(\tau _{t})</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>I consider only human capital investment in education, other important forms of human capital investment such as health and nutrition are not considered here. Attainment of an education level by an individual is a more complex decision making process than assumed here. Generally, parents make the initial investments such as preschool investments and investments up to college or so, until the child reaches enough maturity to make his own schooling decision. Family background can have great influence on educational attainment in several other ways. For instance, suppose that the quality of preschool investment of parents’ time at home affect children’s motivation and persistence to continue schooling. Then, of course, more highly educated parents can provide better learning environment for their children at home. Similarly, more highly educated parents with their better knowledge base of child care, or simply because of their higher incomes can provide better prenatal and post-natal care, and health care for proper cognitive and affective developments of their children.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>An individual in period <span class="math inline">t</span> of ability <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}</span> and family background <span class="math inline">s_{t-1}</span>is denoted by the index <span class="math inline">\xi _{t}=\left( \tau _{t},s_{t-1}\right) .</span>The distributions of individuals in period <span class="math inline">t</span> is characterized by the pdf <span class="math inline">f_{\xi _{t}}\left( \tau _{t},s_{t-1}\right) =g(\tau _{t}).\pi _{t-1}\left( s_{t-1}\right) ,</span> where <span class="math inline">\pi _{t-1}\left( .\right)</span> is the pdf of the schooling distribution of the parents in period <span class="math inline">t.</span> The effect of the above types of family ground is assumed to affect his cost of obtaining a level of education <span class="math inline">s_{t}</span>. Denote this cost function for agent <span class="math inline">(\tau _{t},s_{t-1})</span> by <span class="math inline">\theta_{t}(s_{t},\tau _{t},s_{t-1})</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Assume that all individuals have identical linear<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> utility function <span class="math inline">u(c_{t})</span>, where <span class="math inline">c_{t}</span> is the consumption of an adult of period <span class="math inline">t</span>. An adult of period <span class="math inline">t</span> with cognitive ability <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}\in \mathcal{T}</span> and parental educational background <span class="math inline">s_{t-1},</span> takes the wage function <span class="math inline">w_{t}(s_{t})</span> of period <span class="math inline">t</span> as given and decides his education level <span class="math inline">s_{t}\in \mathcal{S}</span> by solving the following problem:</p>
<p><span id="eq-eq1"><span class="math display">
\sigma _{t}\left( \tau _{t},s_{t-1}\right) =\arg \max_{s_{t}\in \mathcal{S}
} u\left( w_{t}(s_{t})-\theta (s_{t},\tau _{t},s_{t-1})\right)  
\tag{1}</span></span></p>
<p>For regular cases, there is a unique optimal solution <span class="math inline">s_{t}</span> for each agent <span class="math inline">\xi _{t}=\left( \tau _{t},s_{t-1}\right)</span>. Notice that in this framework, all individuals with cognitive ability <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}</span> and family background <span class="math inline">s_{t-1}</span> behave identically. Denote the optimal solution of the choice problem in <a href="#eq-eq1">Equation&nbsp;1</a> for agent <span class="math inline">\left( \tau _{t},s_{t-1}\right)</span> by <span class="math inline">\sigma _{t}\left( \tau _{t},s_{t-1}\right)</span>.</p>
<p>I assume that the production sector is competitive; the producer is risk neutral; there is no affirmative action in hiring, i.e., workers with the same level of schooling are treated the same way, no matter what their family backgrounds are. In each period <span class="math inline">t\geq 1</span>, a producer announces a wage schedule <span class="math inline">w_{t}(s_{t})</span> for hiring purposes. He observes the education level <span class="math inline">s_{t}</span> of a worker but not his innate productive ability level <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}</span>. The employer holds a subjective belief about his productivity level <span class="math inline">e\left( s_{t},\tau _{t}\right)</span> given his education level <span class="math inline">s_{t}</span>. This belief is represented by a condition density function <span class="math inline">q_{t}\left( e_{t}|s_{t}\right) ,e\in \mathcal{E},s_{t}\in \mathcal{S}</span>. Perfect competition, and expected profit maximization imply that <span class="math inline">w_{t}(s_{t}) =\int e_{t} q_{t}\left( e_{t}|s_{t}\right) de_{t}</span> in equilibrium.</p>
<p>The economy begins at time <span class="math inline">t=1</span> with an adult population whose parents’ education level is distributed as <span class="math inline">\pi _{0}\left( s\right)</span>. Given <span class="math inline">\pi _{0}</span>, the transition probability density function <span class="math inline">p_{t}\left(s_{t}|s_{t-1}\right)</span> determines the dynamics of the schooling distributions <span class="math inline">\pi _{t},t\geq 1</span>.</p>
<p>The signaling equilibrium is recursively defined over time as follows: At the beginning of time period <span class="math inline">t</span>, the population density function <span class="math inline">\pi _{t-1}\left( s_{t-1}\right)</span> is known. A competitive producer knows these and he knows the distribution of <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}</span> in the population, but he does not observe an individual agent’s cognitive ability level <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}.</span> The employer holds a subjective belief <span class="math inline">q(e_{t}|s_{t})</span> and announces an earning function <span class="math inline">w_{t}(s_{t})=\int e_{t} q(e_{t}|s_{t}) de_{t}</span> for hiring purpose. Given <span class="math inline">w_{t}(s_{t})</span>, each worker <span class="math inline">\left( \tau _{t},s_{t-1}\right)</span> decides his optimal education level <span class="math inline">\sigma _{t}\left( \tau _{t},s_{t-1}\right)</span> as in <a href="#eq-eq1">Equation&nbsp;1</a>. Given the probability distributions over family backgrounds, <span class="math inline">\pi _{t-1}\left( s_{t-1}\right)</span> and innate ability <span class="math inline">g(\tau _{t}),</span> the optimal schooling decision variable <span class="math inline">\sigma _{t}\left( \tau _{t},s_{t-1}\right)</span> induces a joint probability distribution of <span class="math inline">\left( s_{t},\tau _{t}\right)</span> in period <span class="math inline">t.</span> Denote the joint pdf of the <span class="math inline">\left( s_{t},\tau _{t}\right)</span> by <span class="math inline">f_{s_{t},\tau _{t}}\left( .,.\right)</span>. This joint distribution of <span class="math inline">\left( s_{t},\tau _{t}\right)</span> induces a conditional distribution of <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}</span> given <span class="math inline">s_{t}</span>, denoted by <span class="math inline">f_{\tau _{t}|s_{t}}\left( .\right)</span>. This conditional distribution together with the productivity function <span class="math inline">e_{t}=e\left( s_{t},\tau _{t}\right)</span> produces the observed distribution of productivity levels <span class="math inline">\hat{q}_{t}(e|s_{t})</span> for each level of <span class="math inline">s_{t}</span>. We have a signaling equilibrium, when the anticipated distribution coincides with the above observed distribution, i.e., <span class="math inline">q_{t}\left( e_{t}|s_{t}\right) =\hat{q} _{t}\left( e_{t}|s_{t}\right)</span> for all education levels that are chosen by some agent in the population.</p>
<p>Notice that optimal schooling choices <span class="math inline">s_{t}=\sigma \left( \tau_{t},s_{t-1}\right)</span> determines the transition probability measure <span class="math inline">P_{t}\left( s_{t}\in A|s_{t-1}\right)</span> of an individual born in the family background <span class="math inline">s_{t-1}</span> moves to a family background <span class="math inline">s_{t}\in A</span> as follows:</p>
<p><span id="eq-eq2"><span class="math display">
P_{t}(s_{t}\in A
s_{t-1})=\int \mathcal{I}_{A}\left( \sigma \left( \tau

\tag{2}</span></span></p>
<p>The transition probabilities for earnings between period <span class="math inline">t-1</span> and period <span class="math inline">t</span> can be defined similarly. The transition probability distribution <span class="math inline">P_{t}\left( s_{t}\in A|s_{t-1}\right)</span> determines <span class="math inline">\pi _{t},</span> the distribution of <span class="math inline">s_{t}</span> in each period <span class="math inline">t</span> as follows</p>

<!-- 
In signaling literature, however, the existence of signaling equilibrium is not a problem, the problem is that there exist many of them. How to find them, and select one of them! One approach to equilibrium selection would be to use some refinement arguments such as the notion of sequential equilibrium, or Bayesian Perfect Equilibrium. These are not explored in this draft. Our focus is instead on issues such as what kind of intergenerational mobility, wage growth and total factor productivity growth the model generates during the transition to a stationary equilibrium, and in the stationary state? Whether there exists multiple equilibria; whether the economy is generating maximum potential growth? Answers to these questions are mostly contained in the transition matrix $P_{t}.$

<p>For simplicity and without loss of much generality, I assume that <span class="math inline">\theta _{1}\left( s_{t}\right) =s_{t}</span>. I consider two cases below. First I consider the case in which cost of education depends only on <span class="math inline">\tau</span> and not on family background <span class="math inline">s_{t-1}</span>. In this case, from the observable optimal schooling level <span class="math inline">s_{t},</span> the unobserved cognitive ability level <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}</span> or the productivity level <span class="math inline">e\left( s_{t},\tau _{t}\right)</span> of the worker could be predicted perfectly. Then I consider the case in which cost of education depends on both <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}</span> and the family background <span class="math inline">s_{t-1}</span>. In this case the observed optimal education level can predict the unobserved cognitive skill level imperfectly. I then compare how the distribution of earnings and education levels become more unequal due to signaling role of education.</p>

<p>Assume that cost of education does not depend on the family background of the child, i.e.&nbsp;family background does not have effect on child development. Let it be more specific as <span class="math inline">\theta _{2}\left( \tau _{t},s_{t-1}\right) =\tau _{t}^{-\alpha }</span> where, <span class="math inline">\alpha &gt;0</span>. The pdf of <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}</span> is assumed to be log-normal as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">

</span></p>
<p>From the first order condition of the agent’s schooling choice problem <a href="#eq-eq5">Equation&nbsp;5</a>, we have <span class="math inline">w_{t}^{\prime }\left( s_{t}\right) =\tau _{t}^{-\alpha }</span>. Note that given schooling level <span class="math inline">s_{t},</span> one can perfectly predict his ability level <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}</span> as I mentioned earlier. Denote this forecasting rule by <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}=\left( w_{t}^{\prime }\left( s_{t}\right) \right) ^{-1/\alpha }</span>. This prediction of <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}</span> given the optimal schooling level <span class="math inline">s_{t}</span> is equivalent to the degenerate pdf <span class="math inline">f_{\tau _{t}|s_{t}}\left( \tau _{t}|s_{t}\right) =1</span> if <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}= \left( w_{t}^{\prime }\left( s_{t}\right) \right) ^{-1/\alpha }</span> and <span class="math inline">f_{\tau _{t}|s_{t}}\left( \tau _{t}|s_{t}\right) =0</span> otherwise. The equilibrium is attained if <span class="math inline">w_{t}\left( s_{t}\right) =\int e\left( s_{t},\tau _{t}\right) f_{\tau _{t}|s_{t}}\left( \tau _{t}|s_{t}\right) d\tau _{t},</span> which in our case simplifies to the following first order differential equation,</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\frac{dw_{t}(s_{t})}{ds_{t}}=\left[ \frac{s_{t}^{\rho }}{w_{t}\left( s\right) }\right]^{\alpha}
</span></p>
<p>The above first order non-linear differential equation is in the separation-of-variables form and can be solved explicitly. The general solution of this differential equation is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">
w_{t}\left( s_{t}\right) =\left[ c+\frac{\alpha +1}{\alpha \rho +1}
s_{t}^{\alpha \rho +1}\right] ^{\frac{1}{1+\alpha }}\text{, where }c\text{

</span></p>
<p>Each value of <span class="math inline">c</span> will give a signaling equilibrium and there are continuum of them. Using the initial condition <span class="math inline">w\left( 0\right) =0</span>, the equilibrium earnings function becomes, <span id="eq-eq7"><span class="math display">

\tag{9}</span></span> To compute the equilibrium distribution of schooling levels and the wages, note that <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}=\left( w_{t}^{\prime }\left( s_{t}\right) \right) ^{-1/\alpha }</span>. Substituting the value of <span class="math inline">w_{t}^{\prime }\left( s\right)</span> from the above, and taking natural log, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\ln</span> on both sides, we see that <span class="math inline">\ln\left( s_{t}\right) =\frac{1}{1-\rho }\ln \frac{\alpha \rho +1}{1+\alpha } +\frac{\alpha +1}{1-\rho }\ln \tau</span>. Thus, the equilibrium schooling distribution in period <span class="math inline">t</span> follow the following log-normal distribution, <span id="eq-eq8"><span class="math display">
s_{t}\sim \Lambda \left( \frac{1}{1-\rho }\ln \frac{\alpha \rho +1}{1+\alpha

\right] ^{2}\alpha ^{2}\sigma _{\tau }^{2}\right)  
\tag{10}</span></span> and the equilibrium wage distribution in period <span class="math inline">t</span> is also a log-normal, <span id="eq-eq9"><span class="math display">

<p>One can compute the transition probability density function for schooling levels of two generations <span class="math inline">f_{s_{t}|s_{t-1}}\left( s_{t}|s_{t-1}\right)</span> and the transition probability density function for earnings <span class="math inline">f_{w_{t}|w_{t-1}}\left( w_{t}|w_{t-1}\right)</span> and compute a measure of schooling mobility and earnings mobility.</p>

<p>It is possible that when other labor market mechanisms such as quits layoffs which would break the pooling of individuals to smaller and finer subclasses and thus the inequality will be further increased and social mobility will also improve. We see in the log-normal case that when labor market mechanisms that help to lower the pooling groups in the equilibrium increases inequality and increases social mobility.

<p>To gain further insights about the nature of the equilibrium dynamics of earnings inequality, social mobility and growth, I consider the following simple economy for much of this paper. Let <span class="math inline">\mathcal{T}=\left\{ 1,2\right\} ,</span> <span class="math inline">S=\left\{ 1,2\right\}</span>. Assume that the number of talented workers with high education level create social productive knowledge which generate growth in earnings.</p>
<p><span id="eq-eq15"><span class="math display">
e(s,\tau )=\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
e_{1} &amp; \text{if }s=1,\forall \tau \in \mathcal{T} \\
e_{2} &amp; \text{if }s=2,\tau =1 \\
e_{3} &amp; \text{if }s=2,\tau =2
\end{array}
\right.  
\tag{17}</span></span> An interpretation of the above is that the workers with education level <span class="math inline">1</span> are unskilled workers and the talent of the unskilled workers do not affect their productivity; however, higher educated talented workers have higher productivity than higher educated not-so-talented workers.</p>
<p>Does there exist any signaling equilibrium, and if there exists one, are there many equilibria? Is there an equal opportunity separating equilibrium? Does any of these equilibria attain maximal growth and social mobility? The answers to these questions depend on the productivity technology <span class="math inline">e(\tau ,s)</span> and the cost function, <span class="math inline">\theta (s_{t},\tau _{t},s_{t-1})</span>. I assume that the cost function <span class="math inline">\theta (s_{t},\tau _{t}.s_{t-1})</span> satisfies the following: <span id="eq-eq16"><span class="math display">
\left.
\begin{array}{c}

<p><strong>Signaling equilibrium 1:</strong> Suppose the employers in period <span class="math inline">t</span> hold the following subjective probability distribution <span class="math inline">q_t\left( e|s)\right)</span>of productivity level <span class="math inline">e</span> given his schooling level <span class="math inline">s,</span> which in matrix form is given by <span class="math display">

</span></p>
<p>Given the above expectations, the employer announces the following wage schedule:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
w_t(s_t)=\left\{

e_2.(1-p)+e_3.p &amp; \text{if }s_t=2
\end{array}
\right. \;\;\text{for all }t\geq 0
</span></p>
<p>Given the above wage schedule, one can easily verify that the equilibrium schooling decisions <span class="math inline">\sigma _t(\tau _t,s_{t-1})</span> of an agent of talent type <span class="math inline">\tau _t</span> from the family background <span class="math inline">s_{t-1}</span> is as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">

2 &amp; \forall \tau _t\in \mathcal{T} if s_{t-1}=2
\end{array}
\right. \;\;\text{for all }t\geq 0
</span></p>
<p>It can be easily checked that given the above optimum solution, the observed conditional probability distribution of <span class="math inline">e</span> given <span class="math inline">s_{t}</span> will coincide with the anticipated one. Note that the the transition matrix associated with <span class="math inline">\sigma _{t}(.)</span> is the following: <span class="math display">
P_{t}=\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}
\right) \forall t\geq 0
</span> Thus in this economy there is no intergenerational mobility. Furthermore, the economy is in steady-state from the beginning. Thus, the number of highly talented highly educated workers <span class="math inline">R_{t}=</span> <span class="math inline">p</span> <span class="math inline">\cdot \pi _{0}^{2}</span>, and hence the productivity growth rate is given by <span class="math inline">\gamma (p\pi _{0}^{2})</span> which is strictly less than <span class="math inline">\gamma (p)</span>, the maximum attainable productivity growth rate for the economy when all talented individuals from all socio-occupational groups obtain higher education.</p>
<p>This equilibrium is not equal opportunity separating, nor maximal growth separating type. In this equilibrium, all talent types of the children from each type of family backgrounds are pooled.</p>
<p>Could there be any other equilibrium for the above economy? For a certain subclass of the above economies, there is another equilibrium, which is growth enhancing separating and is Pareto superior to the above equilibrium. To see this, consider the following:</p>
<p><strong>Signaling equilibrium 2:</strong> let <span class="math inline">v_{t}\equiv \frac{p}{p\pi _{t-1}^{1}+\pi _{t-1}^{2}}</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">v_{t}&gt;p</span> <span class="math inline">\forall t\geq 1</span>. At <span class="math inline">t=1,</span> <span class="math inline">v_{1}</span> is known. Let us suppose that apart from the assumption in <a href="#eq-eq16">Equation&nbsp;18</a>, the cost function also satisfies the condition: <span class="math display">
\theta (2,2,1)&lt;\left( e_{2}-e_{1}\right) +v_{1}\left( e_{3}-e_{2}\right)
&lt;\theta (2,1,1)
</span></p>
<p>Suppose the employer holds the following subjective probability distribution for the productivity type <span class="math inline">E_{t}</span> given <span class="math inline">S_{t}</span>: <span id="eq-eq17"><span class="math display">
\overline{q}_{t}\left( e

\right] \;\;\text{ for all }t\geq 1  
\tag{19}</span></span> According to <a href="#eq-eq4">Equation&nbsp;4</a>, given above expectations, the employer announces the following wage schedule: <span class="math display">

1 &amp; \text{ if }s_{t}=1 \\
e_{2}.(1-v_{t})+e_{3}.v_{t} &amp; \text{ if }s_{t}=2
\end{array}
\right.
</span> Given the above wage schedule, the original <span class="math inline">\sigma _{t}(\tau _{t},s_{t-1})</span> will be optimal for all <span class="math inline">(\tau _{t},s_{t-1})</span> except for <span class="math inline">\tau _{t}=2</span>, <span class="math inline">s_{t-1}=1</span>, who will choose <span class="math inline">s_{t}=2</span>. It can be easily checked that for this optimal solution, the observed conditional probability distribution of $ e_{t}$ given <span class="math inline">s_{t}</span> will coincide with the anticipated one in <a href="#eq-eq17">Equation&nbsp;19</a>. Note that the transition matrix associated with this new optimal schooling decision <span class="math inline">\overline{s}_{t}^{\ast }(.)</span> is as follows: <span class="math display">
\overline{P}_{t}=\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1-p &amp; p \\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}
\right)
</span> Thus in this economy there is intergenerational mobility. The proportion of population with higher education will go on increasing and the proportion of the population with lower education will go on decreasing. This process, however, cannot go on for ever, since in that case <span class="math inline">v_{t}\rightarrow p</span>, as <span class="math inline">t\rightarrow \infty</span>, which will mean that there will be some finite <span class="math inline">t_{0}&gt;1</span> such that <span class="math inline">v_{t_{0}}&gt;\theta (2,2,1)</span> for the first time and then on the equilibrium will switch on to the previous one with no mobility. Note, however that the new steady-state equilibrium growth rate will be <span class="math inline">\gamma \left( \pi _{t_{0}}^{2}\cdot p\right)</span> since <span class="math inline">\pi _{t_{0}}^{2}&gt;\pi _{0}^{2}</span>. Furthermore, the short-run growth rate up to period <span class="math inline">t_{0}</span>, is higher in the second equilibrium than in the first type; and the second equilibrium is Pareto superior to the first.</p>
<p>Furthermore, notice that there will be a positive wage growth during all periods <span class="math inline">t\le t_0</span>, and after <span class="math inline">t_0</span>, the source of growth is only from factor productivity growth.</p>
<p>Thus, in this economy there may exist multiple equilibria; which one will actually realize depends on the expectations of the employers. The question is then, how the employer’s expectations are formed? We need a theory of expectations formation of the producers to select an equilibrium, and we do not pursue this theory here.</p>
<p>Also note that the first signaling equilibrium will be in stationary state from time <span class="math inline">t=1</span>, will produce no social mobility in any periods. The second signaling equilibrium will produce upward mobility from social class <span class="math inline">s=1</span> to <span class="math inline">s=2</span> up to time <span class="math inline">t=t_{0}</span> according to the transition matrix <span class="math inline">\overline{P }_{t},</span> and during this period, there will be a positive wage growth due to upward mobility; after period <span class="math inline">t_{0}</span>, however, the process will revert to the mobility pattern of the first signaling equilibrium. Two equilibria, however, will produce two different long-run income distributions.</p>

# Parental altruism, investment in human capital and mobility {#sec-sec5}

In @sec-sec2, we assumed that cost of schooling depends on one's family background which we assumed to represent children's learning environment; individuals had no control over it. This assumption that the ''destiny'' of children are fixed by birth (as in the ''Indian caste system'') might seem very restrictive. Parents care about their children's welfare. Thus, they may like to incur preschool human capital investment so that their children have better environment for learning. Would this change the basic nature of the equilibrium we studied in @sec-sec2? We examine these issues here.

We assume that the cost of producing signal $s_{t}$ for an individual of talent type $\tau _{t}$ in period $t$ depends on the level of parental preschool investment $h_{t}$ which is now decided by parents. We further assume that a preschool investment of $h_{t}$ on an adult of period $t$ costs his parents $h_{t}$ amount of $t^{th}$ period resources; we assume as in the previous section that the cost of obtaining signal $s_{t}$ for an adult with talent level $\tau _{t}$ and preschool investment $h_{t}$ is proportional to the t-th period productivity level as follows: 
$$
\theta _{t}(s_{t},\tau _{t},h_{t})=A_{t}.\theta (s_{t},\tau _{t},h_{t})
$${#eq-eq4-1}

In this section, we identify an adult agent in period $t$ by his preschool
investment $h_{t}$ and talent level $\tau _{t}$ and denote him by $\left(
\tau _{t},h_{t}\right)$. As in the previous section, the employers in
period $t,$ $t\geq 1,$ form their subjective beliefs regarding the
relationship between schooling level and the productivity level of workers
who are in the job market, and announce a competitive wage schedule, $
w_{t}\left( s_{t}\right)$ . A worker $\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right)$ in
period $t$ takes this wage schedule and his schooling cost function (\ref
{eq4-1}) as given and decides his optimal schooling level $s_{t}\left( \tau
_{t},h_{t}\right)$ as in (@eq-eq5 ), and the preschool investment, $
h_{t+1}$ on his child. We further assume that the parents do not observe
their children's ability when making the preschool investment decisions.
The budget constraint of the agent $\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right)$ is given
by: 
$$
c_{t}=w_{t}\left( s_{t}\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right) \right) -\theta \left(
s_{t}\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right) ,\tau _{t},h_{t}\right) -h_{t+1}
$${#eq-eq4-2}
We assume that agent $\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right)$'s decisions to invest
on their children's human capital are guided by the following expected
altruistic utility function: 
$$
E_{\tau _{t+11},\tau _{t+2},...}U_{t}\left( c_{t},c_{t+1}...\right) =E_{\tau
_{t+11},\tau _{t+2,}...}\sum_{\iota =0}^{\infty }\beta ^{i}u\left(
c_{t+i}\right)  
$${#eq-eq4-3}
We assume that there are finite number of human capital investments choices
from the set $\Xi =\left\{ h^{1},h^{2},...,h^{_{\widehat{h}}}\right\} .$ Let
us denote by $\xi _{t}$ the probability distribution of the agents $\left(
\tau _{t},h_{t}\right)$ in period $t$, i.e., $\xi _{t}\left( \tau ,h\right) 
$ $\equiv P\left\{ \left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right) =\left( \tau ,h\right)
\right\}$, is the proportion of the adult population that belong to the
group $\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right) =\left( \tau ,h\right) .$ We assume
that the initial distribution $\xi _{0}$ is given. Because of the Markovian
structure of the problem, the optimal policy functions will be of the form 
$$
h_{t+1}=\psi _{t}\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right)  
$${#eq-eq4-4}
for all agents $\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right)$ in period $t\geq 1$.
Corresponding to a policy in (@eq-eq4-4), we define a binary variable $
\zeta _{t}\left( h_{+1},\tau _{t},h_{t}\right)$ by 
$$
\zeta _{t}\left( h_{t+1},\tau _{t},h_{t}\right) =\left\{ 
\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \text{if }h_{t+1}=\psi _{t}\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right) \\ 
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{array}
\right.
$$

Given the distribution $\xi _t$ of agents $\left( \tau _t,h_t\right)$ in
period t, and given above $\zeta _t\left( h_{t+1},\tau _t,h_t\right)$ and $
\sigma _t\left( s_t,\tau _t,h_t\right)$ for all agents $\left( \tau
_t,h_t\right) ,$ we get the number of researchers $R_t$ and the distribution
of agents $\left( \tau _{t+1},h_{t+1}\right)$ for the next period as
follows:

$$
R_t=\sum_{s_t\geq \bar{s},\tau _t\geq \bar{\tau},h_t\in \Xi }\sigma _t\left(
s_t,\tau _t,h_t\right) \xi _t\left( \tau _t,h_t \right)  
$${#eq-eq4-6}
$$
\xi _{t+1}\left( \tau _{t+1},h_{t+1}\right) =g\left( \tau _{t+1}\right)
\sum_{\tau _t,h_t}\zeta _t\left( h_{t+1},\tau _t,h_t\right) \xi _t \left(
\tau _t,h_t \right)  
$${#eq-eq4-7}

The economy moves over time as follows: The initial distribution of agents, $
\xi _{1}$ is given; the employers announce a competitive wage schedule $
w_{1}\left( s_{1}\right) ;$ agent $\left( \tau _{1},h_{1}\right)$ chooses a
decision rule $h_{2}=\psi _{1}\left( \tau _{1},h_{1}\right) ,$ and a
schooling rule $s_{1}\left( \tau _{1},h_{1}\right) ,$ then \eqref{eq4.2} determines his consumption, and the binary variables $\zeta
_{1}\left( h,\tau _{1},h_{1}\right) ,$ and $\sigma _{1}\left( s_{1},\tau
_{1},h_{1}\right)$ that are associated with the decisions $\psi _{1}(.)$
and $s_{1}(.)$ are determined, and we can then compute the number of
researchers $R_{1}$ and the distributions of agents for the next period $\xi
_{2}$ from equations (@eq-eq4-6) and (@eq-eq4-7); this process iterates
over time to get all the future quantities. All these decisions need be
coordinated in signaling equilibrium, which we define as follows: All agents 
$\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right)$ for all $t\geq 1$ decide their optimal
schooling policies $\sigma _{t}\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right)$ and employers
announce the wage schedules $w_{t}\left( s_{t}\right)$ based on their
subjective beliefs such that $\sigma _{t}\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right)$ and 
$w_{t}\left( s_{t}\right)$ attain signaling equilibrium in every period, $
t\geq 1,$ which we studied in previous section. Given these decisions, the
policy $h_{t+1}=\psi _{t}\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right)$ for every agent $
\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right)$ maximizes his utility function in (\ref
{eq4.3}) subject to the budget constraints in (@eq-eq4-2). Let us denote
the maximized value of utility function of agent $\left( \tau
_{t},h_{t}\right)$ by $V_{t}\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right)$. Given the
schooling decision $\sigma _{t}\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right)$ we get the
distribution of social status in period $t$ for all $t\geq 1$ from 
$$
\pi _{t}^{s}=\sum_{\tau _{t},h_{t}}\sigma _{t}\left( s,\tau
_{t},h_{t}\right) \xi _{t}\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right) ,\;\;s\in \mathcal{S}
$${#eq-eq4-8}
How do we compute such an equilibrium? Could we use the recursive structure
or a Markovian structure of the dynamic programming? This framework may not,
however, produce the recursive structure generally used in standard
neoclassical stochastic growth models . To see this notice that since there
are generally multiple signaling equilibrium wage schedules in every period
that we have seen in the previous section, the equilibrium wage schedule $
w_{t}\left( {}\right)$ may differ in two periods for the economy with
everything else same if the employers use different equilibrium conditional
probabilities $q\left( .\right)$ in two periods. We rule it out by assuming
that employers hold the same conditional expectations and thus announce the
same wage schedule when the economy consist of the same distributions of
workers and their preschool investment. Under these assumptions, we can
solve agent $\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right)$'s optimal decision problem
using he following the following functional equation of a dynamic
programming problem: 
$$
V_{t}\left( h_{t},\tau _{t}\right) =\max_{h_{t+1}}\left[ u\left( \widehat{w}
_{t}\left( h_{t},\tau _{t}\right) -h_{t+1}\right) +\beta E_{\tau
_{t+1}}V_{t+1}\left( h_{t+1},\tau _{t+1}\right) \right]  
$${#eq-eq4-9}
where, 
$$
\widehat{w}_{t}\left( \tau _{t},h_{t}\right) \equiv w_{t}\left( s_{t}\left(
\tau _{t},h_{t}\right) \right) -\theta \left( s_{t}\left( \tau
_{t},h_{t}\right) ,\tau _{t},h_{t}\right)
$$
We further assume that the instantaneous utility function $u$ satisfies the
property that $u(x.y)=u\left( x\right) .u(y).$ Let us use a transformation $
\widetilde{V}_{t}\left( h_{t},\tau _{t}\right) =V_{t}\left( h_{t},\tau
_{t}\right) /u\left( A_{t}\right) .$Then the problem (@eq-eq4-9) becomes 
$$
\widetilde{V}_{t}\left( h_{t},\tau _{t}\right) =\max_{h_{t+1}\in \Xi }\left[
u\left( \widehat{w}_{t}\left( h_{t},\tau _{t}\right) -h_{t+1}\right) +\beta
E_{\tau _{t+1}}\widetilde{V}_{t+1}\left( h_{t+1},\tau _{t+1}\right) \right]
$${#eq-eq4-10}

We can use techniques discussed in @Stokey.Lucas_1989_Book to analyze the
above functional equation and hence the nature of the stationary equilibrium
for continuous state space; these, calculations are, however, unmanageable
in our context. We have chosen to use discrete and finite number talent
types, education levels, and choices of the human capital levels. This
allows us to use modified policy iteration algorithm developed in @Puterman_2005_book, and the computer algorithm code for it developed by @Lamond.Boukhtout_1996 to compute explicitly an equilibrium. Furthermore, we can use the
linear programming techniques to check if we can have certain type of
signaling equilibrium. These calculations are not shown in the paper.
However, in the next example, we consider a numerical example and compute
explicitly a stationary Markov perfect signaling equilibrium using the MDPS
software and using our own code in Maple. The schooling decisions and the
transition probability matrix of this example is identical to that in
example \autoref{example3}, and hence not reported here.

<li id="fn1"><p>The general practice in the human capital literature is, however, to treat S as continuous variable, more realistically it is a discrete set.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p> There is a long controversy over the issue of whether children’s innate ability is genetically inherited from parent’s innate ability. The scientific consensus is that the correlation between parent’s innate ability and a child’s innate ability is somewhere between 0.3 to 0.7. I assumed it to be zero, for simplification. There are other controversies regarding talent, ability and intelligence. Some believe that one is born with a fixed level of intelligence, and training and environment has no effect on intelligence. Others do not agree with it, and believe that ability, intelligence and talent could be improved to some extent with better environment and training. Some believe that intelligence or innate ability is fixed when one is born, and less intelligent people can learn and do complex things that we face in our everyday life, in school curricula, and in modern jobs, except that they might take longer, and thus less productive; this is the view we take in this paper.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
