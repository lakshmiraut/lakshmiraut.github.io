  abstract = {Continuity of preferences imposes behavioral restrictions on the preferences such as impatience or myopia. This paper extends the notions of myopia due to Brown and Lewis, and their characterization of the Mackey topology in terms of myopia, from l to L. Then this characterization of the Mackey topology on L is used to extend Araujo's theorem on the necessity of impatience for the existence of competitive equilibrium from l to L.},
