summary: Identification of factors and prediction of the risks of diseases are important for public policies and disease diagnosis in health care. The biomedical literature suggests that much of an individual’s later life health outcomes is programmed at early stages of life. The programming is strongly modulated by the epigentic inputs created by the environment in mother’s womb at prenatal stage and also by the environment at early postnatal ages. The most important epigenetic factor is stress of any kind – psychological, financial, social and chemical. Other significant factors are diet, smoking, substance use, and exercising. These modulating factors are important throughout life, with stronger effects imparted in early stages of life. I use the most popular statistical model – mulinomial logit model – and the neural network model – multi-layer deep learning model – for identification of important determining factors and prediction of the risks of various diseases that individuals experience in their middle ages. I use the Health and Retirement Studies (HRS) data to that end. I compare their predictive powers using confusion matrix indicator and discuss various criteria used by these two methods to identify the important factors of the risks. I discuss pros and cons of these two types from prediction and inference viewpoint.
