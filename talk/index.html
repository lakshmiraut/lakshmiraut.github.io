  <a href="/talk/2021-02-20-parikh-fesch-mnl-neuralnet/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Identification of factors and prediction of the risks of diseases are important for public policies and disease diagnosis in health care. The biomedical literature suggests that much of an individual’s later life health outcomes is programmed at early stages of life. The programming is strongly modulated by the epigentic inputs created by the environment in mother’s womb at prenatal stage and also by the environment at early postnatal ages. The most important epigenetic factor is stress of any kind – psychological, financial, social and chemical. Other significant factors are diet, smoking, substance use, and exercising. These modulating factors are important throughout life, with stronger effects imparted in early stages of life. I use the most popular statistical model – mulinomial logit model – and the neural network model – multi-layer deep learning model – for identification of important determining factors and prediction of the risks of various diseases that individuals experience in their middle ages. I use the Health and Retirement Studies (HRS) data to that end. I compare their predictive powers using confusion matrix indicator and discuss various criteria used by these two methods to identify the important factors of the risks. I discuss pros and cons of these two types from prediction and inference viewpoint.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <a href="/talk/2020-01-04-aea-multi-state-rnn-lstm-paper/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Health outcomes such as serious diseases and death develop sequentially over one’s life span. Genetic and epigenetic factors, and health related behaviors throughout one’s life condition those health outcomes. Some individuals develop one or more diseases and their health deteriorate faster, worsening their quality of lives and survival probabilities. The models in health economics literature formulate progression of health outcomes over the life span using the multi-state time to event framework, and estimate the effects of the above mitigating factors on probabilities of transitions from one health state to another. The sequential nature of health progression is captured in the Markovian structure. Markov chain models have short memory, i.e., these models assume that given the current health outcome, the past does not influence the probability of transition to another health outcome. Many chronic diseases such as cancers and heart diseases manifest as a result of long lagged past health behaviors. Markov chain models are limited in capturing these effects. More recently, long short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) models are developed in the machine (deep) learning literature that keep track of important features from the past inputs in its memory cells, which the model determine important in the ‘context’ of the future outcomes. These models are generally applied to natural language processing, creating audio streams, and video subtitling. In this paper, I adapt the existing LSTM-RNN models for the prediction of sequential health outcomes in mid-ages. I first compare the merits and shortcomings of these two approaches and then use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data to compare their performances in predicting sequential health outcomes.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>The paper studies determinants of enrollment onto the Social Security&rsquo;s DI (Disability Insurance) and SSI (Supplemental Security Income) programs or death before reaching age 65.  As individuals age, the homeostatic regulatory mechanism that controls physiological body systems&ndash;such as respiratory, cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, immune, and metabolic&ndash;becomes more and more frail in its ability to face internal and external stressors. This leads to one-or-comorbid chronic diseases (such as diabetes, cancer, vascular, musculoskeletal, cognitive and mental disorders), DI-qualifying disabilities or death. The speed of progression through these health states depends on the rate of depletion of one’s homeostatic health and frailty levels. Genetic and epigenetic factors comprised of internal and external environments, health care use, health related behavior and cognitive endowments modulate the depletion rate of homeostatic health over  life cycle. These, in turn, determine the likelihood of various pathways through the health states. I use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data to estimate a multi-state time-to-event model of pathways through these health states. I use  biomarkers such as BMI, CES-D, measures of cognitive health, and indicators of health related behaviors such as smoking, drinking, exercising and use of preventative care along the life-course as indicators of latent homeostatic health and frailty levels and how they affect the risks of following various pathways to disability or death before reaching age 65.</p>

      <p>The growing income inequality has been a big concern for economists and policy makers around the world. Many factors are responsible for the observed burgeoning income inequality, such as capital outflow, relocation of jobs, declining labor union, i.e., declining bargaining power of the labor, poor regulation of financial institutions, corruption, and all-encompassing globalization. Incomes of the bottom 99 percent population in a society comes mainly from earnings, and much of the earnings inequality results from the inequality of skill formation. The children of poor socioeconomic status stays behind skill accusations as compared to their rich counterpart. In modern technology-rich economies, providing high quality education to the talented individuals and matching their jobs with the highly productive technical sector is crucial for economic growth, earnings inequality and social mobility. Because education is used as a signal for a worker’s unobserved endowment of talents, its acquisition by various social groups distorts productive efficiency, lowers social mobility and increases earnings inequality. This paper provides a signaling equilibrium framework to study these issues.</p>

      <p>Using the one percent CWHS sample of the Administrative data on around 3 million individuals, this paper studies the pattern and determinants of the rate at which workers get into the DI rolls. It uses a competing relative risk Cox hazard model with time varying covariates to examine how the gender, race, and changing economic incentives over the life-cycle affect the probability of one’s getting into the DI rolls. It estimates the rate at which disability related health status of US workers has been changing over time, and the effects of the unemployment shocks and the replacement rate (measured as the ratio of expected DI benefits to average recent earnings) on the propensity to get into the DI rolls. The paper also estimates a baseline DI entitlement rate that can be interpreted as proportional to the natural rate of DI entitlement by age after other estimated factors have been taken into account.</p>

      <p>It is known that the human brain develops between age 0-8. And it develops almost at the speed of light between age 2-3. The stimulus that is given during this time is most important for the child’s later development. But many children from the poor families are not able to develop skills such as social, motivational and cognitive due to the circumstances in their home and neighborhood. Education was important for the children of the poor families to move up in the social ladder. But the lack of social, motivational and cognitive skills, which are important for school and labor market success, affects their social mobility. With a good preschool program, it is possible to create a structured learning ability, self-esteem, self-confidence and cognitive developments. A better performance at the elementary level boost the self-confidence and esteem of the children of the poor which help them do well in later years in school and college as well,</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Individuals develop adverse health conditions as they get older, which limit their earnings, resources, and well-being. Workers also face uncertainty about their life spans, which affect their savings and consumption decisions. Many well-known economic characteristics of these risks prevent private markets from pooling these risks adequately. Pay-as-you-go social insurance programs &ndash; by levying payroll taxes on workers and paying benefits to disabled workers, retirees, and survivors &ndash; can substitute for these missing markets. In addition to sharing these two types of risks, such programs will affect the aggregate capital stock, consumption, and the elderly poverty rate. This paper models the risk sharing and the aggregate effects using a calibrated stochastic overlapping generations general equilibrium model. The paper uses as a benchmark the stationary equilibrium of an economy in which individuals self-insure themselves against these risks by adjusting their own saving, and compares this benchmark to the stationary equilibriums of economies with simplified old-age insurance (OASI) and disability insurance (DI) programs, alone and in combination (OASDI). The representative worker&rsquo;s lifetime welfare is computed in the benchmark and the alternatives. Optimal replacement rates for the model&rsquo;s OASI and DI programs are also calculated.The main findings of the paper are that the OASI and DI programs in the model economy together improve the lifetime welfare of workers, reduce the variation of consumption and asset holdings over the life cycle, and virtually eliminate elderly poverty that may arise from these two sources of income shocks. The welfare-equivalent increase in consumption at all ages in the benchmark would be about 14 percent for the DI program alone or 11 percent for the combined programs. The OASI program in the model, however, does not improve individual well-being. This might be due to several factors. First, similar to other models in the literature, this model assumes that the accidental bequest of an individual is redistributed equally among living individuals, which effectively mimics an actuarially fair annuity market with some progressive redistribution. This undermines the annuity role of the OASI program. Second, the model disregards the survivors' benefits components of the OASI program, which would increase the welfare of an individual from an increase in welfare of his survivors. The paper finds that the optimal replacement rate to be zero percent for the OASI program without the survivors' benefit component and with equal sharing of unintended bequest, and the optimal replacement rate for the DI program to be 90 percent.</p>

  <a href="/talk/1999-06-03-world-bank-motives-for-investment/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>This paper proposes two alternative models of intergenerational transfers linking parental investment in human capital of children to old-age support. The first model formulates these transfers as a pure loan contract and the second model as self-enforcing reciprocity. Both models predict neutrality of intergenerational redistribution of resources within the family, also known as the “difference in income transfer derivatives property”. Two models, however, provide different reasons for the failure of this property, and yield different policy implications for parental human capital investment and provision of old-age support. Specification tests on the Indonesian Family Life Survey data reject the pure loan model in favor of the reciprocity model. The estimated difference in income transfer derivatives for this data is found to be significantly higher than the difference estimated by Altonji, Hayashi and Kotlikoff Altonji et al. (1992) [Altonji, J.G., Hayashi, F. and Kotlikoff, L.J. (1992). Is the Extended Family Altruistically Linked? Direct Tests Using Micro Data.

  <a href="/talk/1997-12-18-marseilles-france/" class="summary-link">
    <div class="article-style">
      <p>In every society to attain higher rate of economic growth and efficiency, it is important that individuals with high abilities and talents acquire skills through higher education. The process of human capital accumulation begins with parent&rsquo;s investment on the agent when he/she is a child. An important controversy in modeling such decision has been the issue of what is the motive for parents' investment in their children&rsquo;s human capital. A commonly observed fact is that while in all countries parents invest a substantial amount of resources in the human capital of children, in less developed countries substantial resource transfers occur from children to parents, whereas such resource transfers from children to parents are thinner in developed countries. These transfers patterns are sometimes used to postulate the hypothesis that in less developed countries parents' investment in their children is more like lending to children; whereas in developed countries parents' investment in their children is mainly due to the fact that parents are altruistic towards their children. These two different motives have different implications for growth and efficiency. Since parents can observe the children&rsquo;s abilities, and society cannot, under the first motive removing the credit constraints of the poorer parents will lead to higher growth and efficiency, whereas, under the altruism motive, there is always over-investment in less able children and thus lower growth and efficiency. Thus under the first motive the society can and under the second motive the society cannot rely on parents for attaining efficiency in allocation of educational investments. In this paper we first address these issues in a theoretical model, and then we use the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) data set to find evidence of Indonesian parents' motive.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>This paper provides a model of intergenerational social mobility and economic growth, in which innate ability of workers, and the type of their education and jobs determine the rate of technological progress and social mobility. The innate ability and hence productivity level of an individual is private knowledge. Education not only increases productivity level, more so for the higher ability individuals, it also acts as a signaling device for one’s innate productive ability for the purpose of job matching in the labor market. It is shown that in economies with one-time non-renegotiable wage contracts, there are generally multiple signaling equilibria, all being far away from generating the maximum attainable rate of social mobility and economic growth. There are no natural economic grounds that can guide to select a particular equilibrium. Various labor market practices such as quit, layoffs and promotions based on worker’s or employer’s subjective assessment of on-the-job realized productivity, or explicit wage contracts contingent on some publicly observed noisy measurement of realized productivity, can improve some of the inefficiencies, and hence increase the rate of economic growth and social mobility. The remaining inefficiencies, however, can only be removed by intervening in the education system. The paper analyzes briefly a few education systems, and within the dual private-public education system, the paper examines the role of school vouchers or subsidies to the children of poorer family backgrounds in improving the rate of economic growth and social mobility.</p>

      <p>This paper demonstrates that an accelerated hazard framework is more appropriate than commonly used proportional hazard framework to model the timing of marriage and timing and spacing of children. Using the 1976 Malaysian Family Life Survey Data and selecting an appropriate duration model, the paper tests the old-age security and gender preference hypotheses and estimates the replacement effect. The paper finds strong evidence for the old-age support hypothesis&ndash;If parents have sufficient wealth to support themselves during their old-age, they have longer birth intervals; the Chinese have higher likelihood of depending on their children for old-age support than the Malays, and higher is the husband’s earnings, the less likely is the couple’s dependence on children for such support. The paper finds weak evidence for son preference hypothesis&ndash;The number of sons has no effect on the birth intervals of the Malays whereas it has significant negative effect up to three children for the Chinese. Regarding the replacement effect the paper finds that in response to a child death, parents like to have shorter durations up to fourth child and thereafter, the effect is not significant; the desired family size of the Chinese is higher than that of the Malays.</p>

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>This paper studies the inter-temporal relationships among population growth, income distribution, inter-generational social mobility, skill composition of the labor force, and household income in an overlapping generations general equilibrium model that aggregates household decisions regarding fertility, savings and investment in human capital of children. It shows that as a consequence of endogenous fertility, the equilibrium path attains steady state from the second generation. Income tax transfer, child taxation, and social security taxation policies that can be devised to affect these variables are also analyzed. The model provides a structural explanation for the inverse household income-child quantity and negative child quality-quantity relationships that are observed in developing countries. It also shows that group interests may hinder the emergence of perfect capital markets with private initiatives.</p>
